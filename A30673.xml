            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT fares with me, as 'tis fabled of <hi>Pan,</hi> that pretended Rural God, who being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Preſence to ſhew his skill upon his Oaten Pipe, at the first he was baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and timerous, but being uncontrouled, he grew bolder, and Pip't louder; This was my Caſe when I wrote the enſuing Letter, which was in a dark and gloomy Day; my Baſhfulneſs, and Senſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs when it was finiſh'd, had like to have ſtrangled it in the Womb, and to have kept it from your ſight, fearing what
<pb facs="tcp:59683:3"/> Reception it might meet with; but knowing what ever was wanting, a good Meaning and an Intention to do good was not wanting; and after ſome conflict in my ſelf, I reſolved to put it to the venture, and ſend it I did, but your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind Acceptance beyond my Expectation, made me Pipe louder, and without your privity I ſent it to the Preſs, thinking, that having past this Test, and you approving of it, others al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo might poſſibly do the ſame, but had you past it by with a Check or Diſreſpect, you had ſpoiled my Muſick; yet durst I not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix your Name to it, as thinking it unworthy of you. But your kind Acceptance of it when it was Printed, and Approbation, doth make me yet bolder to prefix your Name, and tell the World to whom it doth of right belong; and this will be ſome excuſe for me, that you did not manifest your diſlike, nor forbid me to do it, the Reaſons why I did this, and do now again Publiſh it were given you then, there were many worthy Friends then, and ſince that time, that lay under the like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of Providence that you did, <hi>viz.</hi> That had parted with their near Relations, to whom I was willing to give a Word of Advice and Comfort but my Occaſions would not permit me to Speak or Write to all, neither was I able to do it to all that needed my Advice; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imagining what doth one good, may benefit another alſo, I made it publick; this Letter
<pb facs="tcp:59683:3"/> may ſpeak my Mind when I am abſent, even to thoſe to whom I cannot come; for I ſee Grace itſelf will not wipe off immoderate Tears, but they ſometimes flow like a mighty Torrent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bank or Bottom, and tho' here be ſome things peculiar to your Condition in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet in the general 'tis of publick concern, the Diſeaſe is common, and the Receipt I hope will not be uſeleſs. Most People first or last are concerned in parting with Relations, here are Conſiderations to quiet them, at least they ſee the Death of others as well as of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and here are profitable Inſtructions to improve that for their own good, and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to prepare for their own Death. Theſe Conſiderations made me make that publick, which at first was intended for private uſe, and I hope this ſecond Edition will give your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, no Offence, nor to read your Name in the Front; when I ſent the Letter to you, I did foreſee that I must ſhortly come into the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace again, and ſo I did the very Week I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the printed Book, I B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lord grant I may learn the Leſſon my ſelf I am teaching others; ſome Additions I have made, at the Request of ſeveral which may be more needful to others then to you; I hope they tend towards the perfection, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the Book.

               </gap>ting with my Eldeſt Son, as you have done with your Eldeſt Daughter, he being one in whom I took no ſmall content, and from whom I expected much Comfort in my Age; the Lord grant I may take the ſame Counſel I give to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When firſt I heard of your great, and (as I think) unexpected Loſs, and how ſoon your Joy, that a Man-Child was born into the World, was turned into Sorrow, that a Woman was taken out of the World. I confeſs I was ſuddenly ſurprized with Amazement, and cryed out, How vain a thing is Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, and how vain are all theſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory things we ſo much dote upon? And how little can they do for us when we have moſt need? And how fooliſh are we to ſpend our time and <hi>money for that which is not bread, and our labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> When I ſaw ſo fair a Flower, ſo lately budded, and not fully blown, ſo ſoon withered and dead, and what need we had, eſpecially that were much older, to ſtand upon our Guard, not knowing the day nor hour wherein our Lord and Maſter comes. When I had ſpent ſome time in theſe Conſiderations, and bewailed the Publick Loſs, I began to conſider your Condition, who by reaſon of your tender, and haply too tender Love, and Care of your Children, eſpecially (as I imagined) of her, who was your Firſt-born, and the beginning of your Strength, and one who by reaſon of her Age and Maturity more fit for your more intimate So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I was afraid your Burden would not be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59683:6"/> eaſily born; for I conceive you are better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to bear a heavy Burden of another Nature than this, ſtrong Affections many times breed ſtrong Afflictions, but God will have us hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, Wife and Children, and our own Lives for his ſake. Theſe things conſidered, I could not but ſympathize with you in your Suffering, and put my Soul as it were in your Soul's ſtead, and ſo bewailed and condoled your Condition, having many times my ſelf felt the weight of your Burden, I thought then with <hi>Job,</hi> That <hi>to thoſe that are afflicted pity is to be ſhewn by his friend,</hi> Job 6.14. But barely to pity, and not to endeavour to help, is but a poor kind of Charity; but it was out of my reach any other way to help, than by Counſel and Advice, and this I knew you needed not, yet not willing to be altogether ſilent, I reſolved to communicate to you my own Experience, and what it was that hath once and again calmed thoſe tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts that raged in my Breaſt. But could I but imagine that your Sorrows were over, your Griefs ſuppreſt, your Trouble buried, and your Burden eaſed, I ſhould not be ſo uncharitable as to take them again out of the Aſhes, or blow the fire that is too apt of it ſelf to kindle; but I fear the Flame is too great to be ſo ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and your Diſtemper too deeply rooted to be ſo eaſily removed; and the Wound too great, to be ſo eaſily healed. Or that I could but imagine your Sorrows were moderate, and no more than your Duty, I ſhould not put you to the trouble of Reading, nor my ſelf of Writing theſe following lines. But I not only fear, but alſo hear that you are a Woman of a ſorrowful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59683:7"/> Spirit, drench'd in Sorrow, over-power'd with Grief, and, like <hi>Rachel,</hi> weeping for your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will not be comforted, becauſe ſhe is not: And fearing, as others of your Friends do, what the event will be, in parting with this dear Pledge, or rather Piece of your ſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I read Godly Perſons have ſometimes been ſtrangely tranſported with Paſſion upon ſuch Occaſions; as <hi>Jacob</hi> at the ſuppoſed Death of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 37.33. when he refuſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and reſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d to go down to the Grave with him; but he ſhould have learned to bury his Children and Friends when alive, by acting their Death to himſelf afore-hand. He ſhewed his Fatherly Love to his Son, but not his own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Father. The next that offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our conſideration, is <hi>David, a man after God's own heart,</hi> yet not without his Faults and Failings; we find him exceſſively mourning for the Death of rebellious <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that had kill'd his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> forc'd his Concubines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd againſt him, and ſought his Life; yet when he was cut off by a deſerved Death, partly by the hand of God, he mourns, and over-mourns, till he was ſoundly chidden and threatned by <hi>Joab,</hi> and wiſh'd he had dyed for him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. We ſee Grace ſometimes at an under, and Nature predominant. Theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I thought it was my Duty, not only to mourn with you, but to comfort you; not only as a Chriſtian, but alſo as a Miniſter, whoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is <hi>to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon,</hi> and to comfort the comfortleſs. Troubles I know ſeem harder and heavier, and are worſe born when they come ſuddenly, and unexpectedly, as I ſuppoſe this did,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59683:7"/> fore-warn'd fore-arm'd; the more expectations we have of Trouble, the better preparation; but unexpected Troubles ſurprize us before we get on our Armour, and then tyrannize over us; doubtleſs then 'tis our Wiſdom to be always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Guard. Nature I know is prevalent, if not curb'd by Grace, but Grace is given to ſome to check its Extravagancies, and to regulate our diſordered Affections. The love of Chriſt, when 'tis predominant in the Soul, leſſens or deadens our Affections to all Earthly Enjoyments; the more directly we behold the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Glory, the more dim-ſighted we are when we turn our Eyes to any Earthly Object. When a Chriſtian acts as a Chriſtian, and hath his Converſation in Heaven, he is ſet in a more Superiour Orb, that all theſe Sublunary things ſeem ſmall, and work ſmall alteration in him. But while our Graces are imperfect, (and that will be while we are on this ſide Heaven) we ſhall find Corruption ſtirring; but 'tis our Duty to take part with the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and to make <hi>no proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the lust thereof.</hi> One of the Devil's Temptations to <hi>Job</hi> to make him murmur againſt God, was the death of his Children: And this is your Tryal at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but in a lower degree, he loſt Ten at once, beſides other Loſſes, and that by an untimely Death, and, as might be imagined, by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand of God; but the Devil was fruſtrate of his purpoſe, inſtead of curſing he bleſſed God, as I hope you will <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> There are I know too many that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the Loſs, which never gave God thanks
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59683:8"/> for the Gift. We are by Nature like ſullen Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if we have not what we would, we will not have what we may; if one thing be taken from us, we will throw all the reſt after it; if we may not have the Knife, we will none of the Meat. If <hi>Rachel</hi> may not have Children, ſhe matters not Life it ſelf; <hi>Give me children, or elſe I die, Gen.</hi> 30.1. not conſidering that God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Key of the Womb alſo under his Girdle, <hi>For children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward,</hi> Pſal. 127.3. One Croſs many times overſhadows a thouſand Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and hides them out of our ſight, and if one Comfort be ſnatch'd away, we can take comfort in nothing; we are like unto pettiſh <hi>Jonah,</hi> that would dye in a pet, and told God to his face, <hi>he did well to be angry, even to death,</hi> Jonah 4.8, 9. And why was he in ſuch a ruff? Why, the Gourd which he loved was withered, and then all God's dealing with him, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating himſelf to him, ſending him upon his Errand, delivering him out of the Whale's belly, ſignified nothing to him; how true is that of the Heathen, <hi>Ira furor brevis eſt?</hi> Anger is a ſhort Madneſs, and theſe are like unto wild Beaſts, hardly tamed. Now, though we are allowed to yield ſomething to Nature in ſuch caſes, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Impatience; yet how apt are we in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to charge God of Injuſtice, and bear our ſelves as if he had wronged us; yea, done us ſuch wrong, that God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Glory, and a thouſand other Mercies would not ſatisfie or make us amends, nor make us leave crying; witneſs our mourning, and over-mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when God manifeſts his Will in taking away
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59683:8"/> our Children, or Relations, without our conſent: He hath croſt us in our Wills, and will not let us have our Humour, in withering ſome Gourd we delighted in, and would have had to flouriſh; and now we are reſolved we will croſs him in his Will, and let him ſay what he will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we will not ceaſe our Complaints. But when we act as Chriſtians 'tis not ſo; when our Graces are not clouded, nor raked up under the Aſhes of Corruption, then it will act otherwiſe; then there will be a total reſignation of our Wills unto God's Will, as two Bells melted together make one: When <hi>David</hi> came to himſelf, he could ſay, <hi>I held my tongue, and ſaid nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou didſt it,</hi> Pſal. 39.9. And good Old <hi>Eli,</hi> when the Lord threatned the ſubverſion of his Houſe, <hi>'Tis the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. And <hi>Job,</hi> though at firſt he quarrels, yet at laſt lays his hand upon his mouth, <hi>Job</hi> 40.30. One Glimpſe of God's Love in Chriſt, is able to dry up all thoſe immoderate Tears we ſhed upon ſuch accounts, and to turn them into another Channel, and make us inſtead of accuſing God, fall out with our ſelves, and our ſins, for provoking him; and when we ſee our chiefeſt Treaſure, our choiceſt Jewels are ſafe, it will make us contemn all our other Loſſes; theſe things we may ſpare, Chriſt we cannot ſpare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> Yet miſtake me not, my deſign, and deſire in this Letter, is not to wipe all Tears from your Eyes, nor all Sorrow from your Heart, for ſome Grief in this condition is doubtleſs Lawful, and your Duty; and 'tis a ſin, yea, an Heathin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſin, to be without Natural Affection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59683:9"/> yea, ſuch a ſin as was condemned by many of the Heathens, that had but the Light of Nature. <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth, <hi>To go to the houſe of mourning; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the living will lay it to heart,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.2. That is, ſo mind it, as to make a good uſe of it, and doubtleſs many profitable Leſſons may be hence learnt: Such ſtroaks as theſe are not given in vain, we ſhould <hi>hear the voice of the rod, and of him that ſends it,</hi> Micah 7.9. Yea, God himſelf complains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the evil to come.</hi> God's Rod hath a Voice, and we muſt hear it, and happy are thoſe that with Correction receive Inſtruction; <hi>When God's hand is ſtretched out, the inhabitants of the world ſhould learn righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 26.9. God is now ſpeaking to us in this Providence, and 'tis our Wiſdom to hear what he ſaith, and to learn what he teacheth. When the Pillars are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Houſe is weakned; and when the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, are taken away, our danger is more: I would have you therefore ſenſible of the blow, as all of us ſhould be when ſuch a Breach is made among us, and when there are fewer helpers, let thoſe that are left put their ſhoulders more ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the Work, to keep up the Building. But my deſign and deſire is to prevent immoderation, which will hinder and not further you in the Work and unfit you for your Duty; you may, you ought do mourn, <hi>but not as thoſe without hope for thoſe that ſleep in the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.13. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Children, when one is beaten, the other will cry, but they muſt take heed of murmuring and repining againſt their Father; <hi>Lute-ſtrings,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59683:9"/> when one is touched, the other ſound; and 'tis one of thoſe Dues which we owe to our decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Friends, to lament at their Funeral; 'tis thoſe uſually that live undeſired, that dye unlamented. It was a Judgment threatned againſt <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> that when he died, he ſhould not be lamented, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18. But we muſt not Water our Plants ſo as to drown them, and that Sorrow that diſables us for our preſent Duty in our general or particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is doubtleſs our ſin. Our chiefeſt care for our Relations ſhould be while they are living, and that is to make proviſion to our power for Soul and Body, but for the Soul eſpecially; for alas, what is a moment of time to Eternity? But when God manifeſts by his Providence, that 'tis his Will to tranſport, and tranſplant theſe Flowers into a better Soil, though we ſhould not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the ſtroak, we ſhould not murmure or repine under it, or accuſe the Hand that gave it, but ſubmiſſively reſign them up to him, who gave them, or rather lent them to us. <hi>David</hi> did what he could for his Son while he was living, but ceaſed mourning for him when he was dead. Our Tears, though they may be ſhed upon other accounts, yet 'tis pity they ſhould run profuſedly in any other Channel but for ſin: It being the true penitential Tears that are the Holy Water that God affects, and the Devil hates; for if any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oſs or Croſs that befalls us, deſerve one Tear, our Sins deſerve a thouſand, for ſin is the cauſe of all our Loſſes and Croſſes that befal us, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will be the deſtruction of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and when we ſee ſuch direful Effects, and taſt ſuch bitter Fruits, we ſhould bewail the Cauſe, and root up the Tree. If our Sin lay heavy, our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59683:10"/> Croſſes would ſeem light; if we bathed our Sins in our Tears, we ſhould not have ſo many left to pour out upon theſe Occaſions. Sin is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Death of your dear Daughter, and will be of your own Death, for had it not been for ſin ſhe had not dyed. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed ever all, for as much as all have ſinned; the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.</hi> Nay, ſin it was that put our ſweet Saviour to death; theſe were the Nails that pierced his Hands and his Feet, the Spear that pierced his Side, his Betrayer, Accuſers, Judge, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; and can your Daughter be more dear to you than God's only and beloved Son was to him? He laid down his Life for her, and her Life is not too good to lay down for him; he laid down his Life to purchaſe for her a Manſion of Glory, and ſhe laid down her Life to go to take Poſſeſſion, for there is no other way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> In my preſent Addreſs to you there are two things deſigned by me. The firſt is, to abate the ſwelling Tide of your Sorrow, and to bring thoſe Waters within their proper Bounds and Banks; which I ſhall endeavour to do by giving you ſome few Conſiderations to Meditate upon, that ſo when the violent Storm of Paſſion ſhall be allayed, Reaſon may be ſpoke with, which cannot many times be heard when Paſſion is raging; and after that, my intention is to point you out ſome of thoſe many profitable Leſſons, which this Providence ſeems to hand out to us, which if we can learn, doubtleſs we ſhall gain by this loſs, or our gains will be greater than our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59683:10"/> loſs; for God's Rod hath a Voice, and 'tis our Duty to hear it, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.9. Nay, 'tis like <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s Rod, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.27. it hath Honey at the end, and if we taſte of it, it will open and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our Eyes. If God with Correction give Inſtruction, we may well ſay, as <hi>David, It was good for me that I was afflicted, before I was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted I went aſtray, but now I learn to keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Quae nocent docent,</hi> is a Proverb, and that Leſſon is beſt learnt that is ſet on with whipping, and beſt remembred. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is ſeldom a ſign of God's hatred, many times of his love; <hi>For whom he loveth he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſcourgeth every ſon that he receiveth: If we endure chaſtening, God dealeth with us as with ſons, for what ſon is he that his father, chaſteneth not. And if we be without chaſtening, then are we baſtards and not ſons,</hi> Heb. 12.6, 7, 8. Amos 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities.</hi> God will be ſure to plow his own Ground, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the waſt; and to weed his own Garden, though others are let alone, to grow wild; the puniſhing Angel muſt <hi>begin at God's Sanctuary,</hi> Ezek 9. And it was no ſign of Love, when God ſaid, <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea 4.17. Since he hath made a match with Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, let him have his belly full of it. When <hi>Ignatius</hi> was thrown to the Wild Beaſts to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I begin to be a Chriſtian;</hi> for Afflictions are the Gemms and Jewels with which God doth adorn his beſt Friends; they are Pledges of our Adoption, and Badges of our Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſo that they are no ſigns of his diſinheriting us, and though he may ſeem to hide his Face,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59683:11"/> yet 'tis no ſign of his forſaking us. But now for the quieting your Spirit under your preſent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and this dark Providence, I beſeech you ponder well theſe few following Conſiderations, which well weighed, may through God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing quell thoſe tumultuous Thoughts that ſwell in your Breaſt; and I deſire the Lord to bleſs them to this end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider who it is that hath done you this ſuppoſed Injury, to take away your Daughter without your conſent: And here you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not only who it is, but alſo what Intereſt he claims in her; and then conſider whether your Plea will hold good againſt him. Is it not the great God of Heaven and Earth, whoſe Power no Creature is able to reſiſt; whoſe Will is his Law, and whoſe Glory is his End? Is it not he that is called Omnipotent, that doth what pleaſeth him in Heaven, and in Earth, and none can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him? And is he a fit Match for you to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with? Is it not he <hi>that meaſureth the water in the hollow of his hand, and meteth out Heaven with his ſpan, and comprehendeth the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, that weigheth the mountains in ſcales, and the hills in a balance. To whom all nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the ſmall duſt of the balance, that taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing: And all nations are before him as nothing, and are accounted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity,</hi> Iſa. 40.12.15.17. <hi>Fear ye not me?

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59683:11"/> bounds to the ſea, and ſaith, Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further; and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed,</hi> Job 38.11. <hi>He numbreth the ſtars, and calleth them by their names,</hi> Pſal. 147.4. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the mountains, and they know not: he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth them in his anger. He ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and maketh the pillars thereof tremble. He commandeth the Sun, and it ariſeth not, and ſealeth up the Stars. He alone ſpreadeth forth the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the ſea. Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> Arcturus, Orion, <hi>and</hi> Pleiades, <hi>and the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſouth. Which doth great things paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and wonders without number,</hi> Job 9.5, &amp;c. <hi>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, and the clouds are his chariot; he walketh upon the wings of the wind. He maketh his angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flaming fire. That layeth the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth, that they ſhall not be removed for ever,</hi> Pſal. 104.3, &amp;c. Is it not he that made the World of nothing, and can as eaſily reduce it into nothing? He hangs the Earth upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that in the midſt of the open Air, and gave a Being to all his Creatures when they were nothing, and nothing comes to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Providence. Nay, is it not he that keeps the Keys of Life and Death at his Girdle? <hi>I kill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I make alive; I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. I lift up my hand, and ſay, I live for ever,</hi> Deut. 32.39. <hi>He brings to the gates of death, and back again, and doth what pleaſeth him in heaven, and in earth, and none can reſiſt him, neither dare any ſay; What doſt thou?</hi> And is this he that hath done you this wrong, and with him is it that you contend? But conſider, <hi>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealouſie,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59683:12"/> are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. Shall we provoke him to a Duel, as ſometime <hi>Caligula</hi> did their Heatheniſh <hi>Jupiter. Was there ever any that hardened himſelf againſt God, and proſpered?</hi> Job 9.4. Who ever could boaſt of the laſt word, or glory in the laſt blow? The Walls of <hi>Aphek</hi> did Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on the Blaſphemous <hi>Syrians,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God upon the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> If we harden our heart againſt God, he will harden his hand againſt us, for he will lay us upon our back, ere he leave. But haply though we do acknowledge God doth excel us in Power, yet we imagine we have the better Cauſe, and therefore, with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nab,</hi> we think we do well to be Angry; or at leaſt, with <hi>Job,</hi> we would diſpute the Point with him, <hi>Job</hi> 13.3. <hi>Surely I would ſpeak to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I deſire to reaſon with God.</hi> Why, what hath God done? Why, he hath taken away your Daughter in the midſt of her days. Well, but hath he no Intereſt in her? Is it not he <hi>whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve?</hi> Was it not he that gave her her Being, and breathed into her the breath of Life, and ſhe became a living Soul? Did he not give her her Being? 'Tis not long ſince there was nothing heard of her; and did he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue her in her Being till her death? Was it not he that fed and cloathed her at his own Coſt and Charges? And was ſhe not engaged to him for every bit of Bread ſhe did eat, and every drop of Drink ſhe drank, and for the Cloathes ſhe did wear? Was it not <hi>his wool, and his flax</hi> that cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed her, <hi>his corn and his wine</hi> that fed her, <hi>his ſilver and his gold</hi> that enriched her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. Let us take heed then of paying our Rent to a wrong Landlord; her Limbs and Senſes, her
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59683:12"/> Peace and Plenty, her Wit and Reaſon, yea, her Life and Breath were given, or rather lent her by God. It was he that covered her in your Womb, <hi>and through him ſhe was born,</hi> Pſal. 139.13. It was he that put bowels of Compaſſion into your Heart, to make Proviſion for her, when ſhe could make none for her ſelf; and to him ſhe was indebted for every breath ſhe breathed, and for every Mercy that rendred her Life more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to her; and doth it become Chriſtians thus to quarrel with our great Benefactor? Or is it meet that we ſhould require of him an Account of his doings? Or expect that he ſhould bring his Will to ours? Whoſe is the Pot but the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and may not he if he pleaſe daſh it in pieces with his foot? And who can ſay, why doſt thou thus? Now, if this great God, this Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Being, this God that hath ſuch an Intereſt in us, and ſuch Authority over us, yea, greater than any Man upon Earth hath over any thing he doth enjoy, hath taken away one of his own Creatures, and glorified himſelf with her that he had made for his own Glory, ſhall we take Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it? That it was his Hand I doubt not but you acknowledge, for nothing comes to paſs without his Providence. <hi>Affliction ſprings not out of the dust, neither doth trouble ariſe out of the ground, yet man is born to trouble, as the ſparks fly upward,</hi> Job 5.6. Theſe things come not to paſs by Fate, or blind Fortune, as the Heathens imaginee, or by Chance, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſuppoſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.9. but the hand of God is in all this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lamenting Church concludes, That <hi>ſhe will bear the indignation of the Lord becauſe ſhe had ſinned againſt him; Why ſhould a living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59683:13"/> a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> Lam. 3.39. <hi>Is there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos. 3.6. That is, the Evil of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Evil of Sin. He is not guilty of ſin, <hi>He is of purer eye than to behold iniquity with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right? Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, if the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Lam. 3.37. <hi>I form the light, and I create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do theſe things,</hi> Iſa. 45.7. Yea, we may find that the Evil that came upon <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> came from God, <hi>Micah</hi> 1.12. For God ſits at the Stern, and guides the great Affairs of the World; and when we ſin, what can we expect from a Righteous Judge but Sufferings? Where ſin goes before, ſorrow follows, as the ſhadow follows the ſubſtance. But now you have found out the Perſon, and the Fact is confeſt, what Accuſation will you form againſt this Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God, ſeeing he hath meddled with nothing but his own Creature, the work of his own hands, and one that he hath a greater Intereſt in than ever you had? What Arguments will you uſe to defend your Cauſe againſt him? <hi>Job</hi> indeed had a good mind to quarrel him, and as good a Cauſe for ought I know as any Man living; for God himſelf commends him above all the Men upon the Earth, for <hi>a perfect and an upright man, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil; yet holdeth he his integrity</hi> (ſaith he to Satan) <hi>although thou movedst me againſt him, to deſtroy him without a cauſe,</hi> Job 2.3. <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God would anſwer me,</hi> Job 31.30. But when God accepted the Challenge, and poſed him with ſome hard Queſtions, he cries out, <hi>I am vile, what ſhall I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59683:13"/> anſwer? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further,</hi> Job 40.4, 5. Yea, we find him at the loſs of his ſeven Sons and three Daughters, the loſs of all his Cattel, bleſſing the Lord: <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> Job. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1. We find him not curſing at the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling at the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> as many would have done; he knew whoever was the Rod, God's Hand held it; and whoever was the Inſtrument, God was the Author. This Conſideration quieted <hi>David,</hi> when that dead Dog <hi>Shimei</hi> railed upon him, and curſed him; <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath bid him curſe</hi> David, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. This quiered good Old <hi>Eli,</hi> when the ſad Tidings of the death of his two Sons, and the ruine of his Family was fore-told, <hi>'Tis the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. This Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo ſilenced <hi>Aaron,</hi> when his two Sons, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> were both ſlain with fire from Heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>held his peace.</hi> He bridled his Paſſion, and ſubmitted his Will to God's Will. And how then dare we diſpute the Point with God, that have neither Might nor Right on our ſide, that are but frail, yea, ſinful Duſt and Aſhes, poor Worms, that if he tread upon us, he leaveth us dead behind him? Who are we, that we ſhould be diſcontent with his dealing, while we have no wrong done us, or think to ſtruggle out of his hand when we have no Power, or be ſullen under his Rod, when 'tis for our own good? God is not engaged to give us any Account of his doing; but ſure it may ſuffice us, when he tells us, <hi>All ſhall work
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59683:14"/> together for our good, if we love him,</hi> Rom. 8.28. And then why not this Providence? We take bitter Pills, and unſavoury Potions upon the Word of a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> when he Sugars them with the hopes of Health: And ſhall we miſtruſt the great Phyſician, that cannot deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Yea, how unſuitable is it for Chriſtians to repine under ſuch Diſpenſations of Providence, who daily pray, <hi>Thy will be done in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, further conſider if you are not Acceſſory to this Croſs that you now lye under: Or have you not a hand in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Rod, wherewith ye are beaten? There are two ways we may be Acceſſory to the Death of our Relations: The one is, by lodging them too near the Heart; even in that Room which Chriſt hath reſerved for himſelf: This makes God like a Jealous Husband, remove that Servant out of the Family, which he ſees his Wife dotes upon; as a Father takes away the Knife, for fear of Danger, or the Meat, for fear of a Surfeit; for many times we graſp thoſe Thorns ſo hard till they prick us to the heart; and then like Children we cry when we have hurt our ſelves. Some on the other ſide through Careleſneſs or Covetouſneſs neglect the neceſſary means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or reſtoring the Health of their Relations. But if you can clear your ſelf of the former, I think all that know you will clear you of the latter; for the hand of God was ſo evidently ſeen in this Viſitation, that no Providence, no C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, no Coſt, nor Pains could prevent, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it; God denying a Bleſſing to all the means
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59683:14"/> that were uſed, and did immediately diſpute his own Right, and claim his own Intereſt, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all Gain-ſayers. Oh how good is it for us to hang looſe to all Creature-Comforts, and not ſet up any Idols in our Hearts, but leave all our Relations to be at God's diſpoſe; for many times we our ſelves weave the Spider's Web out of our own Bowels, with which we are intangled; and twiſt the Snare with our own fingers wherein we are held: Let us therefore in the firſt place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who 'tis that hath done this ſuppoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and the ſerious Conſideration of it will do much to allay the Storms of our Paſſion, and quell and ſuppreſs thoſe tumultuous Thoughts that rage in our Breaſt, and do much towards the calming of our Spirits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as we have conſidered who 'tis we contend with, even the Mighty God of Heaven and Earth; in the next place, 'tis not amiſs to conſider who we are, that thus quarrel him, even Duſt and Aſhes, Worms-meat, poor, frail, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Creatures we are that thus oppoſe the Will of this great God, and find fault with his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World. <hi>What King</hi> (ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt) <hi>going out to make war againſt mother King, ſitteth not down first, and conſulteth whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thouſand? Or elſe while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, and deſireth conditions of peace,</hi> Luke 14.31, 32. And this is our Wiſdom to do when we ſee we cannot grapple with him, to lay down our Arms, and ſubmit and ſue for Peace, before the Contention grow too high; for doubtleſs we may eaſily ſee we are not a meet Match for him,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59683:15"/> our Original is but from the Earth; <hi>The Lord formed man out of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul,</hi> Gen. 2.7. and ere long we muſt be reſolved into Earth, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhall return,</hi> Gen. 3.19. And is ſuch a deſpicable Worm able to contend with the Almighty? Yea, all of us, high and low, rich and poor, noble and baſe, <hi>were bewen out of the ſame rock, and digged out of the ſame hole of the pit,</hi> Iſa. 51.1. And all had the ſame Original, and are poor, frail, contemptible Nothings. <hi>Is my ſtrength</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) the ſtrength of ſtones, or are my ſinews of braſs?</hi> Job 6.12. And what if it were? Were our Fleſh of Braſs, and our Sinews of Iron, could we then grapple with the Almighty? <hi>Was ever any that hardened himſelf againſt God, and proſpered?</hi> Duſt we are by Creation, ſinful Duſt by our Defection, and to Duſt we ſhall return at our Diſſolution. <hi>Our father was an</hi> Amorite, <hi>and our mother an</hi> Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. This may make us ſprinkle the Duſt of Humility upon our Heads. 'Tis ſaid, ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are bred in Sugar, we cannot boaſt of ſo ſweet an Original, but may look back to the ſlimy Clay, <hi>and may ſay to corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother, and my ſiſter.</hi> The greateſt Perſons are but a little Air and Duſt tempered together, but Soul and Soil, Breach and Body, a Pile of Duſt, and a puff of Wind. God need not to Muſter an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt us, if he tread upon us, we are left dead behind him; if he with-hold our breath, we dye, and our thoughts periſh; he can with a frown turn us into Hell, yea, turn Heaven and Hell and all into nothing: And are we able to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59683:15"/> grapple with him? Nay, this is not all; we have not this our poor Being of our ſelves, he it was that made the Clay of nothing, and he it was that gave us our Shape and Being; he was the Potter, and we were the Clay in his hands; he gave us a Being, and 'tis he that gives us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Being. We are his Creatures, and he made us; the works of his hands, and faſhioned us: And <hi>ſhall we thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not be our father that bought us? Hath not be made us, and eſtabliſh'd us?</hi> Deut. 32.6. <hi>Shall the pot ſay to him that made it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Shall the ax exalt it ſelf againſt him that heweth with it?</hi> God hath more Propriety in us than we have in our ſelves, or in any thing we enjoy, yea, in our Children; theſe were given, or rather lent us for a time; and the Soul is but a Tenant at will in the Body. <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God in your bodies, and in your ſpirits, which are God's,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19.20. He gave us our Being, and can if he pleaſe quickly render us a <hi>non entity,</hi> for when he loſt his Property in us we find not; nay, yet more, had we continued in our Integrity, in which we were created, we might have had more to ſay for our ſelves, than now we have. God made us in his own Image, Holy and Happy, but by our ſin we brought not only Death, but all Miſeries attending it: <hi>The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. We are the ſinful Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> and we have inherited our Fathers Corruptions. Infants
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59683:16"/> are no Innocents, the firſt ſheet wherewith they are covered, is woven of ſin and ſhame, blood and filth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.46. The Image of God is loſt, and the Image of Satan ſet in the room; Original Righteouſneſs gone, and Original Sin in the ſtead; and by this means we have debaſed our ſelves below other Creatures, and next to the faln Angels, are become the moſt vile; we became indebted unto God Ten Thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and cannot pay a Farthing; and therefore we were ſold Bond-ſlaves to Satan, under the wrath of God, the curſe of the Law, and liable to eternal Damnation, and may juſtly expect every day to be caſt into Priſon, <hi>till we have paid the utmoſt farthing.</hi> And yet ſhall we contend with our Maker, and complain of wrong, when all that we have on this ſide Hell is free Mercy, and Hell it ſelf is no wrong. Nay, let us further conſider, that we our ſelves are guilty of this we accuſe God for; our Poſterity received their contamination from us, which occaſioneth Death and other Miſeries; for had your Daughter not had ſin, ſhe had not dyed; and this God, which we now quarrel, is our greateſt Benefactor, and freely gives us all that we do enjoy; <hi>We live, and move, and have our being from him; we receive every good and perfect gift from him:</hi> We cannot live a moment without him, and yet ſhall we quarrel him? He gives us our Being, yea, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Being, and maintains us at his own Coſt and Charges ever ſince we had a Being: We have Meat, nor Drink, nor Cloathes to cover us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corn nor Wine, Wool nor Flax, Silver nor Gold, but what is his, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. Neither Wit nor Reaſon, Limbs nor Senſes, Peace nor
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59683:16"/> Plenty, Health nor Strength, Life nor Liberty, but by his Gift; and when he pleaſeth can call for all, or any of theſe from us, for we have not a breath to breath but what he puts into us; and are we fit to Challenge this great God to a ſingle Duel, when we cannot move a Tongue or Finger without his immediate Aſſiſtance; for we are ſo far below him, that if we do well, we cannot benefit him; if ill, we cannot hurt him, <hi>Job</hi> 35.7. The Sun would ſhine in its own brightneſs, though all the World were blind; ſo God will not ceaſe to be Glorious, though all the World were wicked: What can we give him that is not his own? And our offered Incenſe would have a bad ſavour if it did not ſmell ſtrong of the hand that offereth it. The Sun runs his courſe; though the <hi>Atlanters</hi> curſe him at his riſing, being ſcorched with his heat; and alſo the Moon, notwithſtanding the barking of ſnarling Curs. So God diſpoſeth the Affairs of the World; <hi>He ruleth, let the earth be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</hi> But to our buſineſs: The Contention lies between God and us; the Maker and Governour of all the World, and poor Duſt and Aſhes. Who ſhall have his Will, and diſpoſe of God's own Creatures, the work of his own hands; and you ſee on what diſadvantageous ground we ſtand, and may eaſily judge of the iſſue. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in Controverſie is, Whether God can Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Juſtly take away any of thoſe, which we call our Relations, though they are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and bring them out of this Vale of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery unto theſe Manſions of Glory, which he hath provided for thoſe that love him, without our leave and liberty, and free conſent, without
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59683:17"/> doing us wrong. This we ſeem to deny, when we mourn, and over-mourn, and grudge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, when God makes his Will known in ſuch Diſpenſations of Providence; for if this be not it, what is it? He gave you your Daughter, or rather lent her to you for a time, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires but his own, and that to conſummate the Marriage between Chriſt and her Soul, and you ſeem to forbid the Banes, and deny your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Marriage. <hi>Abraham</hi> was of another mind, when he was commanded to Sacrifice his only Son, which was a far greater Tryal; this was his only Child, but yours is not; he muſt be the Inſtrument to take away his Life, this is not required at your hands; he did actively ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, you only paſſively, when you cannot reſiſt; what in this caſe we ſhould do, were we able to reſiſt, I know not. Now, though in plain words we do not ſay God doth wrong us, yet our murmuring at the Providence yields ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that theſe are our thoughts; for if God will not at our Requeſt alter his Eternal Decrees, to pleaſe our Humour, we are diſcontented, and in effect we ſeem to quarrel him, that he did not receive us into his Counſel, when he made his Decrees, and ſeem to ſay, as <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> did affirm, That if he had been of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with God in the Creation, he could have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things better than they were: And we ſeem to think it was not well nor wiſely done of God to determine the Death of our Relations without our knowledge or conſent, eſpecially to call them out of the Vineyard ſo long before Night, though it be but to give them their Wages. Now, if this be not the ſtate of the Controverſie between
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59683:17"/> God and us, I acknowledge I know it not; and in ſuch a caſe what Advocate ſhall we find to take our part, or plead our Cauſe. But let us for once ſuppoſe a poſſibility that we were able by fair means or ſoul, to perſwade God to alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r his unalterable Decrees, that they might be more mutable <hi>than the Laws of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that altered not:</hi> And ſuppoſe he ſhould hang the Keys of Life and Death at our Girdles, a Priviledge which no Man living ever yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: Suppoſe it were left at our diſpoſe, when, and how, and where our ſelves and Relations ſhould dye, do we verily believe we could man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the buſineſs better than he doth in whoſe hands it is? And could we determine of a fitter time, and know better their Work is done, when they could be ſpared, and when they are ripe for Glory? This were preſumption in us to think; ſo, doth not the chief Husband-man better know when his Corn is ready for the Barn, and his Roſes for his Boſom? We ſhould think it Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in a Son or Servant, that ſhould follow the Dictates of his own Will, and prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our juſt Command. But were ſuch a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge granted us, which is impoſſible that it ever ſhould be, we might be the firſt that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it; how oft-times have we ſeen an over-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, or over-cockered Child to be a Scourge to the Parents, and <hi>to bring their gray hairs with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the grave.</hi> Sometimes by their vicious and lewd courſes, which hath made them wiſh they had buried them in their Childhood; ſometimes by continual Sickneſs, Weakneſs, Pains, or other Affliction, Parents have been ſcourged for their inordinate deſires. <hi>Rachel</hi> ſo earneſtly deſired
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59683:18"/> Children, that if ſhe had them not, ſhe muſt die in a pet; God gave them to her, but it coſt her her Life: There are many, that by reaſon of Pains, or other Afflictions, <hi>long for death, and dig for it, as for hid treaſures, and rejoyce exceedingly when they can find the grave,</hi> Joh 3.21, 22. and their Friends are as willing to part with them, as they are to go, and long for their death as much as they deſired their lives. But can we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed think it fit that our Wills ſhould be the Rule of God's actings, or that we are really wiſer than he is? God forbid: haply we are loath to ſpeak out, that theſe are our deſires; but doth not our reluctancy make it out? When a Child murmures, and repines, and cries, and ſnubs, when his Father Commands him to do a thing, doth it not ſhew, that if he durſt, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, and that there is not a full reſignation of his Will to his Fathers Will? He that gives us our lives, and the lives of our Relations, is ever fitteſt to diſpoſe of them. Were Death at our diſpoſe; Heaven would be long empty, our Friends ſhould nor come there yet, and our Enemies never; our Friends ſhould live too long, and our Enemies die too ſoon. But theſe things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we think or ſay to the contrary, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by wiſer Counſels, yea, an irreverſible Decree; <hi>'Tis appointed once to doe, and after death the judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. And we our ſelves ſhall ere long know by Experience, that we are not ſecure from Death's Arreſt; and happy will it be for us if this Purſevant fetch us into Glory, and not force us into Hell: To prevent this, 'tis good to ſubject our Wills to God's Will in all things, for we ſhall never have content or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59683:18"/> in our mind till this be done, but fears and jealouſies what if this or that happen; you ſee how vain it is to oppoſe our Wills to God's Will, and think to reſiſt him, or ſtruggle out of his hand; 'tis a thouſand times eaſier to reſiſt the Tide, and keep it back when 'tis coming in, or to reſiſt the univerſal Darkneſs that follows the ſetting of the Sun. You have heard who 'tis we contend with, and that is God, that can do what pleaſeth him; and who we are that oppoſe him, thoſe that cannot fetch one breath, or move one finger without his aſſiſtance; and what the iſſue of ſuch a Conteſt will be, is not hard to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſ.</hi> We have already conſidered the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties engaged in the Quarrel, it remains that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration be had of the wrong that is done, that if it may be, the Controverſie may be ended. In this Quarrel you are the Plaintiff, and God the Defendant, who hath done the ſuppoſed wrong, and 'tis much if the Judge of the whole Earth ſhould do wrong; and God ſeems to be willing to have it brought to the Tryal, and to ſay, as ſometimes to his own People, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.3. <hi>Oh my people, what have I done unto you, and wherein have I wearied you? teſtifie againſt me.</hi> God need not to give an Account of his Actions, being a free Agent, whoſe Will is his Rule, yet is willing to put the Matter to an indifferent Judge, as he doth the Controverſie which he had with his Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>And now, O Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and men of</hi> Judah, <hi>judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my Vineyard. What could I have done more for my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? &amp;c.</hi> He is willing the World ſhould judge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59683:19"/> whether his ways be equal or no; he deſires a Bill may be drawn up by the Plaintiff againſt him, and his Charge may be known, that he may anſwer for himſelf. The like we read of, <hi>Job</hi> 32.35, &amp;c. <hi>Oh that my adverſary had written a book, I would take it upon my ſhoulder, and bind it as a crown unto me, I would declare unto him the number of my ſteps,</hi> &amp;c. Can you ſay be hath been a hard Maſter, or a dry and barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to you? I know you will not, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; but God may better ſay to you, than <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> to his ingrateful Country-men, <hi>Are you weary of receiving ſo many Courteſies from one man?</hi> Or as Chriſt to the hard hearted Jews, <hi>Many good works have I done among you, for which of theſe do you ſtone me?</hi> Why is it that you complain, and ſpend ſo many ſighs, and ſobs, and ſorrowful tears? Why is your Countenance caſt down, or why doth Diſcontent appear in your Face? Why, God hath taken away from you your Daughter, which you loved, and from whom you expected much comfort, and that without your leave and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iking, and againſt your will. But will this bear an Action? Did not he love her as well as you? And was he not as well able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her? Was not ſhe his, as well as yours? Yea, had he not a greater Intereſt in her? She was his by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ght of Creation, did not he make her of nothing? Was ſhe not his alſo by right of Redemption, when his only Son loſt his Life to buy her out of Slavery? She is Chriſt's by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, being one that his Father gave to him, which he will not loſe, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. And ſhe hath alſo devoted her ſelf to him, and reſigned her ſelf and all ſhe had to his diſpoſe. She is alſo his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59683:19"/> by Preſervation; 'tis he that maintained her at his own Coſt and Charges, ever ſince ſhe had a Being, and paid you well for Nurſing her. Chriſt hath alſo a Matrimonial Right in her, ſhe being eſpouſed to him. In the time of the Law, the Children begotten in Bondage were accounted the Maſter's; and you being God's Servant, he hath an Intereſt in your Children alſo. She is his Daughter as well as yours; his by Adoption: What Intereſt you have, was only given or lent, you being but Inſtrumental in her production, and will you yet diſpute the Point, which hath moſt Right to diſpoſe of her? She call'd him Father, and ſo ſhe was his Adopted Child, as well as you Mother: She was the Work of his hands; he was the Potter, ſhe but the Clay; and whoſe is the Pot but the Pot-makers? He made her for his Glory, and will you not give him leave to glorifie himſelf in her Salvation? By a mutual conſent ſhe is married to Chriſt, and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Wife, will you deny her? If any other lay any claim to her Body, yet the Spirit returns to God that gave it; <hi>He breathed into her the breath of Life,</hi> and 'tis he alone that reſtrains her breath. She was yours indeed by Relation; both you and ſhe are God's by Purchaſe. <hi>You are not your own, but bought with a price.</hi> And he that hath call'd her hence, will ere long ſend for you after her. This is no continuing City, you look for, and ſhe hath found one above, whoſe Builder and Maker is God. While ſhe was here ſhe was a Tenant at will, in a poor crazy Cottage, a Houſe of Clay, ſubject to moulder about her ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: Now ſhe is commanded by the Landlord to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, yet with a Promiſe of a better Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59683:20"/> God hath commanded to pull down this Earthly Tabernacle, and hath provided her a Palace, <hi>A houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens, whoſe builder and maker is God;</hi> and hath exalted her from a Cottage to a Crown. And is this the wrong that you complain of? Hath not God much more cauſe to complain of you, that do what you can to hinder her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. She was under Age, but now comes to Inherit. If you ſay, you had her not long enough, who ſhall be Judge, her Father or you? Do you pretend to any Promiſe of a longer time? Produce it if you can; if not, lay your hand upon your mouth. Could you have provided better for her than he hath done? If not, why do you envy her Happineſs? He hath ſent for her home to his own Court, provided a Husband for her, married her to his Son, who hath lodged her in his own Boſom: And what wrong is in all this? What cauſe of ſighs, and groans, and ſhowers of tears? And he claims as great a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in you as in her, and ere long if it be denied, will diſtrain for it, and try his Title, and repining will do no good; 'tis much better to ſubmit, as <hi>David</hi> did, who faſted and prayed when his Son was living, but when he was dead, comforted himſelf, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not come to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.23. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if a ſeparation muſt be, you had rather have gone before her: But muſt your Will needs be preferred before God's, who gave you liberty to chooſe? Indeed this was <hi>David</hi>'s fault and failing, till he was chid out of this Humour, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>O my ſon</hi> Abſalom, <hi>my ſon, my ſon</hi> Abſalom: <hi>would God I had died for thee, O</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59683:20"/> Abſalom, <hi>my ſon, my ſon. Jonah</hi> in a pet had rather have died, than his Gourd ſhould have withered; he prayed for Death, and told the Lord, <hi>That he did well to be angry, even unto death,</hi> for the Gourd's ſake; but God had determined he ſhould live, and the Gourd ſhould die. Our Lives are not in our own hands, nor in our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, but in the hands of God; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appoint God what to do, or who to call for, neither is it fit we ſhould; he knows beſt when our Task is done, and when we are ready. But you did expect ſhe ſhould have lived longer, but what ground had you to build ſuch an Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon? Tis true, ſhe was young; but do not far younger than ſhe was feel the dint of Death? Yea haply, if it were well conſidered, as many die before they come to her Age, as live beyond it; you your ſelf buried one at a far younger age, your knew ſhe was Mortal, and why ſhould you promiſe her more time than God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her? I am ſure God never made any Promiſe to fruſtrate his Eternal Decrees; ſhe might indeed have lived longer, even to the Age of <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> had God will'd it; and ſhe might alſo have died younger, yea, and never ſaw the Sun. But who is it that he hath made of his Cabinet-Counſel? Or who is it that can come to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for a Leaſe of his own or Friend's Life? But is this all the thanks you render to God for ſparing her with you to comfort you for about Twenty Years, that you murmur? Had it been more, haply had it been Twenty more, the thanks had been all one, and your ſorrow at the parting never the leſs; and will nothing content except we be our own carvers? But ſuppoſe you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59683:21"/> hoped ſhe ſhould ſurvive you, and what then? Would not there have been grief at the parting? But you would have had the burden caſt upon her ſhoulders, but God that bids us take up the Croſs, will have the making of it himſelf, and lays it upon whoſe back he pleaſeth, and will not humour us ſo far as to let us have our will, when it ſtands in competition with his own. And truly this Croſs is ſo perfectly of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that he that runs may read it: But had he made uſe of any Inſtrument, his Hand might have been ſeen in the Work. But ſhe was hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and could not be ſpared; and is not this matter of Comfort to you, which you make the ground of your Grief? The more Gracious, the more Glorious; the more Holy, the more Happy, the better ſhe was, the fitter for Heaven. There are two things which may trouble us at the death of Relations: the one is, when we can ſee no Evidence of Grace; the other, when we have neglected our Duty to them, eſpecially to their Souls, in their life-time. The reaſon why <hi>David</hi> did ſo wofully bewail the Death of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> is imagined to be one or both of theſe. When our Relations are fitted for Glory, I think 'tis no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable wiſh to wiſh them out of a troubleſome World, in thoſe Coeleſtial Enjoyments. <hi>Paul did deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which was beſt of all.</hi> But to wiſh thoſe out of Glory that are in, were both an unprofitable and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deſire, and argues more Paſſion and Self-love, than well grounded Charity. Now, there is no going to Heaven, but through the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of Death; and 'tis through Death's Portal that we muſt enter. She hath paid the Debt we all owe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59683:21"/> and would you have her endure theſe Pangs and Pains over again? You came not into the World together, and it was unlikely that you would go together out; and when ever a parting was, it was like to be with grief. She hath changed her Husband, but 'tis for the better; an Earthly for an Heavenly; ſhe had a large Joynture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but 'tis much amended, 'tis now advanc'd to a Crown and Kingdom. She hath left her Relations behind, but ſhe hath better there, Saints and Angels, the Souls of Juſt Men made perfect: There ſhe can ſerve the Lord without diſtraction, and ſing Hallelujahs to Eternity without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; here Corruption attended her beſt Duties, there <hi>ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more;</hi> here ſhe was troubled with Satan's Temptations, there he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to throw one Dart, or ſhoot one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at her; here ſhe was liable to Pains, Aches, Griefs, and Troubles, all theſe are there removed; here ſhe could ſcarcely open an Eye, or an Ear, but it let in ſin, or ſorrow; <hi>there all tears ſhall be wiped away,</hi> and a ſad or ſorrowful thought ſhall never enter. And what cauſe hath ſhe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of wrong? And if neither of you be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why is this waſt? Why ſo many ſighs, ſo many ſobs, ſo many ſorrowful tears, which might better run in another Channel? Had ſhe liberty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, is there ſuch a wrong done you or her, that God takes her to himſelf before you were willing to part with her, though he had a better Intereſt in her than you could pretend, and made her fit for Glory, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated her thither? You agree both in the thing, but the Quarrel is about the time, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is, whoſe Will muſt be obeyed, or whoſe Judgment muſt be preferred, which is the beſt time. Many of the wiſer Heathens have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with leſs contradiction: <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> when told of the death of his two Sons, anſwered, I knew that they were Mortal; <hi>Et ſtultus eſt qui mortem mortalium deflet.</hi> Now in the preſent Controverſie, may not God ſay to you, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did to his People, <hi>What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone from me?</hi> What wrong have I done, that you thus complain? One of us muſt ſubmit, and muſt it be me? Muſt I alter my Eternal Decrees for your ſake, or will there be no Peace to be had? The Lord may ſay, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban,</hi> when he ſo fiercely purſued him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.36. <hi>What is my treſpaſs? What is my ſin? Declare it before the world, that they may be our judges.</hi> Nay, hath not God in this very Affliction ſugared your Pill, which might have been much bittered; ſhe might have been taken away in her younger years, before you had ſuch hopes of her Integrity, or at leaſt denyed you ſuch Evidence of her Converſion; then might you have feared ſhe had been loſt indeed; or inſtead of one, he might have taken all your Children, when as yet two ſurvive; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59683:22"/> by the ſame ſtroke he might have taken away your dear Husband, <hi>better to you than ten Sons,</hi> as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8. Or he might have ſuffered your Children to be a heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, as too many in theſe days are, by their vicious Lives and Converſations, who bring <hi>their gray hairs with ſorrow to the grave,</hi> which makes them with, with <hi>Auguſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> that they had never married, or had dyed childleſs. Theſe are not ſuch rare Examples in our days, but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. She dyed a Natural Death, many now adays, as well as <hi>Job, Eli, Aaron, David,</hi> and others in former times were not ſo happy, as to ſay ſo of theirs. Neither is there any guilt upon you, as upon ſome that have cauſe to mourn for neglecting any means for the preſervation of her Life, when ſome be wickedly Acceſſory to their Childrens Death. If there were any fault, (which yet I cannot accuſe you of) it was in the exceſs of your Love, which I the more fear, when I ſee the exceſs of your Sorrow; and this is a fault which Indulgent Mothers are apt to run into. But you'll ſay, you could more eaſily have born any other Burden, or ſuffered any other Croſs: Why then it ſeems God hath let you Blood in the right Vein, as he did the Young Man in the Goſpel, that was willing to do any thing Chriſt commanded, but part with his Riches; but Chriſt will have a full reſignation of our ſelves, and all that is ours, or he will not own us. No beloved <hi>Delilah</hi> muſt be retained, the Croſs that Chriſt appoints we muſt bear, and muſt not pick and chooſe our own Burden: <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, wife and children, brethren and ſiſters, and his own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59683:23"/> life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> That is, if he prize any of thoſe before him, or will rather part with Chriſt than with any or all of theſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the name of a Chriſtian; for all we have in the World is given to us as Love-Tokens from God, to ſignifie his Love to us, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our Love to him; and ſometimes God calls back ſome of theſe Gifts, to ſee whether we love him or his Tokens better. God gave you liberty before ſhe dyed, to let her and you ſee the Fruit of her Womb, a Son, which though he ſoon called off the Stage, yet at the Reſurrection <hi>be ſhall ſtand in his lot.</hi> But 'tis farther objected, It was a good Woman: And what then, muſt not good Women dye? If Death would ſpare the Gracious, Heaven would be empty, for no other ſhall go thither. Was ſhe too good to be the Child of God, the Spouſe of Chriſt, an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in Heaven, a Companion for Angels and Glorified Saints? But was not her Goodneſs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given her by her Husband? She had it not by Nature, ſhe was beautiful with the comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he put upon her, and all this was in order to fit her for her Marriage. But was not her Goodneſs your Comfort, as well as her Reward? Had that been wanting, there had been more cauſe of Sorrow than now there is. But ſhe could not be ſpared: For that it is beſt to let God alone with the Government of the World, which he hath ſo wiſely managed for above Five Thouſand Years, and never was yet put to a ſtrait for want of Inſtruments; for <hi>he that of ſtones can raiſe children to Abraham,</hi> never wants Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to do his Work. 'Tis he that took her hence beſt knows whom he can ſpare; doubtleſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59683:23"/> he can raiſe Inſtruments as well as in former times, and qualifie whom he pleaſeth for the Work; his Vineyard ſhall be dreſt, or he will ſend Labourers in at the eleventh hour; ſhe is call'd out by the Owner of the Vineyard, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Wages, who can ſend in more if he want: Had ſhe had more Work to do, ſhe had had more time to do it in; her Father that loves her, knows the World is infectious, and he hath taken her out of the Corrupt Air, leſt ſhe ſhould take the Infection. But ſhe was in the Prime and Flower of her Age, and 'tis pity ſuch Bloſſoms ſhould be nipt; but God beſt knows when his Roſes are ripe, and when they ſhould be pluckt, and when 'tis the beſt Seaſon to gather his Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and if he pluck this Roſe in the bud, to put into his Boſom, what need this Complaint? He takes not his People hence till they are ripe for Glory. Though we know not the reaſon of his doings, doubtleſs he hath wiſe and gracious ends in all his Actions; 'tis not neceſſary for us to be of his Counſel, yet he condeſcends ſo far to us, as to tell us, <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. And why may nor this dark Providence do you good? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the righteous are taken away from the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. And this may be the preſent caſe, and haply you may have more cauſe to mourn that you are alive, than that ſhe is dead; we know not what Cup may be put into our hands, haply ſuch as you would not deſire to ſee her drink. However Troubles and Afflictions are ſo common to Men of all Ranks and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Holy Ghoſt tells us, That <hi>bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for they reſt from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59683:24"/> their labours, and their works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13. To dye in the Lord is a Happineſs, to dye for the Lord, ſaith <hi>Latimer,</hi> is ſuch a Priviledge, that is not granted to the Angels in Heaven: <hi>Mors privare poteſt opibus non operibus.</hi> Death may deprive us of our Wealth, except we have ſent it before us to Heaven, but not our good Works. But this your Daughter was your firſt-born, and was it not fit ſhe ſhould have the Precedency in her Death, as well as in her Birth? The firſt-born hath no Priviledge againſt Death more than the reſt: When Death knocks, all muſt open; yea, God ſeems to claim a greater Intereſt in the firſt-born than in the reſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. Our Saviour Chriſt was the firſt-born, yea, the only Son of his Father, and as well beloved as your Daughter could be, yet ſuffered Death for us: And ſhall we think a Son, or Daughter, or our own Lives too good for him? <hi>Abraham</hi> did not deny his Son, his only Son, when God required him; yea, was content to kill him with his own hands. And till there be a through reſignation of us, and ours, and all we enjoy, to God's diſpoſe, till we are content to be what he would have us be; and do and ſuffer what his Will is, we are not in a Chriſtian Poſture, and God if he love us, will bring us to this, and if one blow will not do it, more ſhall: Our ſtout Stomacks muſt ſtoop, and we muſt bend or break; the beſt way to get from under the Rod is Submiſſion, for we can neither grapple with God, nor ſtruggle out of his hands. Let us now ſum up all that is in Controverſie between God and you, and let us ſee whether it will be a conſiderable Charge. God took away your Daughter without your conſent,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59683:24"/> and againſt your will, laying more claim to her than you can, and brought her out of a ſtate of Miſery, which you had involved her in, out of the Devil's Slavery from under the Curſe of the Law, and the Wrath of God, and Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that by the precious Blood of his own Son, and by Regenerating her, and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her for his Child, changing her Nature, and giving her the diſpoſition of a Child, cloathing her with the rich Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and decking her with the Graces of his Spirit, Eſpouſing her to his Son, providing an Inheritance for her, and when ſhe came to Age, hath tranſported her thither, and gave her Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the purchaſed Inheritance, thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Glory provided for her from all Eternity; wip'd all Tears from her Eyes, and all Sorrow from her Heart, and all Sin from her Soul, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her to his Son, who lodged her in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, gave to her the largeſt Fountain, even a Kingdom of Glory. And for this you mourn, and will mourn, and think you do well to mourn, and, like <hi>Rachel, refuſe to be comforted, becauſe ſhe is not.</hi> This is the wrong that draws Tears from your Eyes, and ſorrowful Sighs and Sobs from your Heart: And may not God call Heaven and Earth to Witneſs againſt you, that your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are cauſeleſs, and your Tears needleſs? Had he taken her in her ſins, and caſt her into Hell, he had wronged neither the one nor the other, though her condition had been deplorable; but now he may ſay of her, as ſometimes of his Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3. <hi>What could I have done more for her than I have done?</hi> And what Reaſon can you give why <hi>you ſorrow as one without hope for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59683:25"/> one that ſleeps in the Lord?</hi> Were it a deed of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, could you prevail to wiſh her out of thoſe Coeleſtial Enjoyments back again into a World of Troubles, Vexations, and Dangers, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear you Company? Do you think that all the Glory, Splendour, and Magnificence; all the Riches, Honours, and Promotions the World ever ſaw, would be a Temptation to her to leave the Beatifical Viſion, and thoſe Rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are at the right hand of God for evermore? Alas, theſe are no more to thoſe Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Enjoyments, than a piece of rotten ſhining Wood to the Sun in its Splendour. And do you think that Twenty Years in Heaven will not make amends for Twenty Years on Earth, which ſhe poſſibly might have lived?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſ.</hi> In the next place it will not be amiſs to conſider how little good your immoderate Mourning will do in this caſe: And truly in the upſhot you will find it will do much more hurt than good, even to your ſelf, and all about you; for by this means you perplex your ſelf in vain, ſo that you can neither enjoy your ſelf nor any thing you have with that ſerenity of Spirit, as otherwiſe you might do; and ſpend that Holy Water, thoſe Tears to no purpoſe, which were deſigned for a better uſe, and ſhould be ſpent upon another Account, and would do more good, did they run in a right Channel. You bewail the Effect, but 'tis much better to bewail the Cauſe, for were that removed, the Effect would ceaſe, <hi>Non valet medicamentum dum ferrum invulnere.</hi> Sin deſerves all the Tears we can ſhed, and 'tis better weep for living Sins than dead Children; if the latter deſerve one Tear, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59683:25"/> other deſerves a thouſand: And it is not for your own ſins alone that this Flood-gate ſhould be opened, but for the ſins of the Times, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſins; for from the greateſt to the leaſt, all have gone aſtray; and if there be not a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we may expect a Deſolation, and God expects ſome to ſtand in the Gap, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. to turn away his wrath from the Nation; and although there be ſo few, that they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for the Nation, yet their own Souls ſhall be ſaved, as God ſaid of <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job, Ezek.</hi> 14.14. Yea, in a common Calamity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives Commiſſion to the Deſtroyer, he marks all <hi>that are mourners in</hi> Sion to be paſt by, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. Here Tears will do good, for the fire of God's Indignation is only to be quenched with the Tears of True Repentance: But I fear there will be in the day of Viſitation few of thoſe Mourners found; few to ſtand up in the Gap, though many that make the Breach wider. This way may do good to your ſelf and others: Thus <hi>Job</hi> concerns himſelf more with his Children when alive, than when dead, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5.21. Now, which way can you imagine that the abundance of Tears which you pour out upon this Account of your Daughter's Death, can benefit either you, or any one elſe? In reference to God, 'tis neither pleaſing to him, neither will it prevail with him; not pleaſing, for he hath forbidden it: <hi>We ſhould not ſorrow as men without hope for them that ſleep in the Lord. For if we believe that Jeſus dyed and roſe again, even ſo alſo them that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.13, 14. And it reflects ſome diſhonour upon him, when his People are ſo unſatisfied with his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59683:26"/> and repine under his Diſpenſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. It makes the World believe they take him for a hard Maſter, yea, and queſtion his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the Act. It is no Credit to a Maſter, when his Servants quarrel at their Diet, their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their Work, and their Wages: Others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there is ſomething in it that makes them complain. Now, God's Glory is his End in all his Actions, and it ſhould be ours, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in the ſight of the World, we ſhould never hang down the head but for ſin, our own ſins, and the ſins of others, becauſe God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſhonoured, and his Laws violated: And then that they cannot be prevalent with God is as evident. You are offended that your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is gone, <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> but 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing to bring her again, and what elſe can you be ſatisfied with? You can never prevail with him to alter his immutable Decrees, which are as firm as the Pillars of Heaven, and the Foundations of the Earth, and the Sun and Moon in their courſes. And then again I am ſure you are not benefited by it, the preſent vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you lye under, muſt needs make your Life uneaſie, yea, make you a burden to your ſelf, thus to ſpend your time <hi>inter ſuſpiria &amp; lachrymas,</hi> between Sighs and Tears, when the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bond-ſlave can do no more. And hereby you alſo diſable your ſelf for your Duties to God and Man, both in your general and particular Calling and Relations. Diſcontent in the Heart makes a Chriſtian, like <hi>Jonah,</hi> inſtead of praying to God, quarrels him, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. What Communion can you keep with God, when there are ſuch tumultuous Thoughts ariſing in the heart?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59683:26"/> Doubtleſs in this pet you cannot ſerve God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction, neither attend your Worldly Concerns; and that Sorrow is never pleaſing to God, that thus diſables you for your Duties, or hinders you in Heaven's way. Neither can there any benefit ariſe to your Friends and Relations; for while you are under ſuch diſcompoſure of Spirit, the whole Family muſt taſt of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; for what comfort can you give others, that refuſe comfort your ſelf? Or how can you Counſel them, that will take no Advice your ſelf? You have been long in the School of Chriſt, and he expects, that being converted, you ſhould ſtrengthen your Brethren. But doth not your carriage put a block in others ways to comfort? This makes you that you can take little delight in your remaining Relations; nay, to overlook, and undervalue all your other Mercies, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read Love in any of God's dealings with you; your finger is ſtill upon the Sore, and this one Croſs hides from your Eyes a thouſand Mercies. It had ſuch an effect upon <hi>David,</hi> though it was no doubt his failing, when God had given him a Signal Victory, and by that means brought him back again into his Throne; yet all this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, becauſe <hi>Abſalom</hi> was dead; and neither God nor Man was thank'd for the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So 'tis with you, the lives of your Husband, Children, Friends, Relations; your Health, Peace, Plenty, Liberty, Senſe, and a thouſand more, ſeem little in your Eyes: All <hi>Haman</hi>'s Honour, Wealth, Promotion, Children, were nothing to him, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> would not bow to him, <hi>Eſther</hi> 5.13. And though God hath given you abundance of theſe outward
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59683:27"/> things, yea, himſelf, and promiſed you Heaven and Glory into the Bargain, yet all this ſeems not ſatisfactory, your Daughter is not. Now, would not this make a Man ſuſpect ſhe was you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Idol, and therefore God took her out of the way, that your Affections might run in the right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Well, but ſeeing no living Creature can be benefited by your Tears, let us ſee whether your deceaſed Daughter may, and here is leaſt ground of all to imagine it. Indeed were the Papiſts Doctrine of Purgatory true, and that Souls might be redeemed by Dirges, Maſſes, and ſuch other Fopperies, then your Money may do ſomething; but this Fire that was kindled to warm the Popes Kitchen, can never be extinguiſhed by your Tears, but by the Oyl of Angels. But to paſs by that exploded conceit, or rather deceit, as a groundleſs Fiction: But whether the Soul be in Heaven or Hell (for a third place the Scripture owns not) it is in a ſtated condition, which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it ſelf cannot alter, and our Tears nothing avail to the one or to the other. In Heaven there can be no augmentation of Glory; for how can they have more than fulneſs of Joy and Pleaſures for evermore? What can they have more than the Beatifical Viſion of God, and Fruition of Glory, than <hi>rivers of pleaſures at God's right hand for evermore?</hi> Communion with, and Enjoyment of God bleſſed for ever. And can your Tears procure greater Glory? Here is the <hi>maximum quod ſic,</hi> the higheſt Pinacle of Glory, as much as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>g Joy in the Preſence of God. And had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59683:27"/> you your wiſh for her, it would fall a thouſand times ſhorter than her real Enjoyment: And what cauſe is there of Tears, unleſs it be in thoſe that envy her Happineſs? Now on the other ſide, miſcarrying Souls can have no diminution of their Torments by the Tears of their Friends; in their life-time Prayers and Tears to God in their behalf had been ſit Phyſick, but when Death comes 'tis too late, let the Papiſts ſay what they will to the contrary; <hi>As the tree falleth, ſo it lyeth; and as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment ſhall find us.</hi> Their own Tears can then do them no good, though they ſhould weep as much Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as there is in the Sea. <hi>There is a time when God will be found, and there is a time when he will not be found.</hi> The Rich Glutton could not in Hell procure one drop of Water to cool his Tongue: There is no Redemption out of Hell, and there is no other place for miſcarrying Souls but Hell; the Tormentors will not be bribed, nor the fire quenched with Tears: <hi>Their worm dyeth not, and their fire never goeth out. Tophet is ordained of old, even for the King it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord like a river of brimſtone doth kindle it,</hi> Iſa. 30.33. So that 'tis evident immoderate Mourning for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friends either needs not, or boots not; thoſe that dye well, are ſet out of the reach of Danger, and thoſe that miſcarry, out of the reach of Recovery. But I deſire you further to conſider, were your Daughter ſenſible in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, what ſorrow you have for her on Earth, which is a thing too hard for me to determine, what thanks think you would ſhe return?

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59683:28"/> execution of his Will, you ſeem to mourn that you are not God, or not able to reſiſt him, or that he made you not of his Counſel when he decreed your Daughter's death, which is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that no Heathen could in plain words own it. And doth not Experience convince you, your Tears are vain? Was there ever any that by mourning brought a Soul out of Heaven or Hell, or got any benefit by it? And will you think you ſhall be the firſt? I know ſome have been raiſed from the Dead, by the mighty Power of God, who had determined it ſhould be ſo, for the confirmation of the Goſpel. But what is this to your caſe? Let your Grief therefore never exceed the bounds of Moderation, for it will never do you good, or any one elſe. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were poſſible to prevail with God in ſuch a Requeſt, and he ſhould give her her choice to go or ſtay, you would be never the better; you would never prevail with her to return: There was indeed ſuch a Petition made to <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Lazarus</hi> to come back into the World, but it was refuſed; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had met with ſuch hard Meaſures in the World, that he was not fond of the Journey; and doubtleſs ſhe would not be perſwaded with all your Arguments to leave the Boſom of Chriſt, and the ſweet Embraces of her dear Redeemer, to accompany you for a while, for long it cannot be, before a ſeparation muſt be made again, for <hi>this is no continuing City;</hi> and truly to wiſh her to leave the perfection of Glory, and to embrace an eſtate of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſubject her ſelf again to Drudgery and Slavery, Pain and Sickneſs, Dread and Danger, Perſecution and Affliction, argues more of Self-love,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59683:29"/> than of true Affection to her; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve when the Paſſion is over, upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you would not do it. If a poor Beggar's Daughter, going from door to door, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and beloved by ſome Mighty Prince, who ſhould take her, cloath and adorn her, marry her, and make her his Queen, and after this her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould perſwade her to leave her Crown and Dignity, her Husband, Honour, and Preferment, and Pleaſure, and go along in her hand as before a begging, it would be hard to perſwade her: The Application is eaſie, and the Condeſcenſion far greater in this caſe, than in that; to leave Heaven, to converſe with you on the Earth; and were it in your power, would you expoſe her again to Sin and Suffering, and to bear again the Pangs of Death? Would you bring her back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Vineyard, now her Work is done, and ſhe is receiving her Wages, to endure the burden and heat of the day, and all to bear you Company? You are groaning under the preſent burden of Mortality, and are ſenſible of your Pains and Diſtempers, and would you wiſh her in the like condition? She is now ſafely landed in the Port of Glory, and would you have her back again upon the raging Sea, toſſed up and down with Storms and Tempeſts, among Rocks and Sands, among Pirates and Robbers, and all this under pretence of Love and Tenderneſs? What worſe can you wiſh to your greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? She is at her Journey's end, and would you have her tread over thoſe weary ſteps again, along the dirty, craggy, rocky, and thorny way, and paſs through thoſe Dangers again ſhe hath once eſcaped. She was an Heireſs, and is come to her

Alas, this is too weak a Bait, to allure a Heaven-born Soul: The New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe is a Citizen, is not to be parallel'd in the whole World. See the deſcription of it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſhadow, for no words in Humane Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can diſcover it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. where Gold and Precious Stones are the courſeſt Materials, yea, too courſe to deſcribe it in its Glory. And for ſpaciouſneſs, the whole Terreſtrial Globe doth not ſo much exceed one ſquare Inch of Earth, as the Heavens exceed the whole Globe. But it may be her dear Husband may allure her; but ſhe muſt then leave a better Husband, even Chriſt, to whom her Soul was eſpouſed before ſhe went. But her Father and Mother are here; but ſhe hath God for her Father, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above is her Mother, and Angels, and glorified Saints her Brethren and Siſters, and conſtant Companions. She was, 'tis true, a loving and dutiful Child, and now is a loving and dutiful Wife, and ſhe cannot tranſgreſs her Maker's Laws, not her Husband's Will. With what ſcorn would ſhe reject ſuch offers as theſe, if made to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her out of Heaven! Her love to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would anſwer all the Objections could be made. But how can you be ſo much againſt the conſummation of the Marriage, that were ſo willing of the Eſpouſals? I know you travelled in Birth till Chriſt was formed in her; it was both your deſire and deſign it ſhould be ſo, and your delight when it was done; and is his fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her home ſo troubleſome? What greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief could you wiſh to the greateſt Enemy you

The World is but a Peſt-Houſe, and every one hath ſome Plague-ſore or other run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon him, and would you deſire any Friend you love to come into ſuch infected Company? It is but a little while and you will follow her; and it will be ſaid of you, as of her, She is dead alſo. And would there not be another ſeparation if ſhe ſurvived? We are in this Life like Men in a croud, almoſt thronged to Death, and he that firſt gets out, is beſt at eaſe; and would you wiſh her again in the midſt of the throng? Now, if you ſay, as I believe you will, theſe are not your deſires to have her back: Why then all theſe Tears, theſe Sighs, theſe Sobs, if you imagine ſhe is better than you? This looks as if you envied her Happineſs, and would have her bear part of your Burden. Nay, immoderate Sorrow ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that you have hard thoughts of her condition, for who can mourn for thoſe he thinks happier than himſelf?? Who mourns for his Childrens
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59683:31"/> Advancement, eſpecially if he knew they were out of Danger; this would look more like Envy than Love, to mourn for another's Welfare. If <hi>Galeacius,</hi> that <hi>Italian</hi> Marqueſs, when he was offered great Riches, if he would renounce his Religion, cryed out, <hi>Let their Money periſh with them, that hold all the Wealth in the World worth one day's Communion with Chriſt.</hi> How much more may a glorified Saint ſay ſo, if he were tempted by the World's Splendour to leave his Coeleſtial Enjoyment, that City of Pearl, that Manſion of Glory, the Beatifical Viſion, the Enjoyment of Chriſt, thoſe Rivers of Pleaſures, to come and make his abode in the World, for any earthly Greatneſs; how ſcornfully would a glorified Saint entertain ſuch a Motion? And how little would theſe Promiſes affect him? The Martyrs that had comparatively but a little taſte of Chriſt, yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed all things elſe in compariſon of him, and forſook all for him; <hi>Yea, loved not their lives to the death,</hi> but laid them down at the Stake for his ſake, and in his cauſe. But now they enjoy him in Glory, what value think you they put upon him? The greateſt cauſe of ſorrow for a dead Child is, when we fear their miſcarrying, and are conſcious of the neglect of our Duty to them, in reference to their Salvation. This we may mourn for, and it may be a corroſive to our hearts, and it ſhould make us careful for the time to come. But to mourn for thoſe immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, that we believe are tranſlated into Glory, and have the higheſt pitch of Happineſs we could wiſh for them, is our weakneſs, or our ſin, or both. Such Tears will neither glorifie God, nor benefit us or our Relations, living or dead, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59683:32"/> are ſpent in vain. And ſeeing weeping cannot prevail with God, nor with our departed Friends to return, let us dry up thoſe Tears, and make no more ſuch waſt, but turn them into a right Channel, and mourn for ſin, which is the cauſe of their Death, and of our Trouble.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The laſt Conſideration I ſhall commend unto you, is to conſider your own Condition, the uncertainty of your Life, and the haſt that Death makes to poſt you after her; yea, you are following your lamented Daughter at the very heels: For when your Part is play'd, you will march off the Stage. How ſoon a parting blow will be given to divide you from your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relations, you know not; how ſoon Death will enter into your Lodgings: had your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lived, 'tis not likely you would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued long together. You have lived a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, the moſt People in the World die younger; why then take it you ſo ill that your Daughter is ſtept over the Stile before you, when you your ſelf are ready to tread upon her heels, and to tread out her foot-ſteps? <hi>Yet a few years, and then I ſhall go whence I ſhall not return,</hi> Job 16.22. <hi>And your place will know you no more,</hi> Job 7.10. The thread of your Life will ſoon be cut, which can never be pieced; and your Glaſs run out, which will never be turned; and the Day be over, which will never dawn again. Such Meditations of Death did always run in <hi>Job</hi>'s mind, he is much upon this Subject, and had Death always in his Eye: And the like would do you no hurt, but much good. <hi>O remember that my life is wind, mine eye ſhall no more ſee good: The eye of him that hath ſeen me ſhall ſee me no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59683:32"/> more: Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. As the cloud is conſumed and vaniſheth away, ſo he that goeth down to the grave, ſhall come up no more. He ſhall return no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him any more,</hi> Job 7.7, &amp;c. <hi>Let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, before I go hence, whence I ſhall not return, even to the land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Death, whether it ſtrikes you or your Relations, gives a parting blow; and which ever goes firſt, the other will not ſtay long behind. Now, is it worth the while to ſpend your days in ſorrowing for your dead Daughter, when ſhe hath drunk that Health that you your ſelf muſt ſo quickly Pledge? Or to wiſh her again for ſo ſhort an Enjoyment, when one of theſe days you will enjoy her to Eternity, when ſhe ſhall be much more lovely than here ſhe was? If you place your Happineſs in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of your Relations in this Life, 'tis a ſhort-liv'd Happineſs, and you will ſhortly have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay, as one about to leave the World, <hi>Spes &amp; fortuna vale te,</hi> Farewel Hope and Comfort for ever. But ſure while God is preſent, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian need not care much who is abſent. If we could be as ſenſible of the with-drawings of God from the Soul, as of the departure of Friends and Relations, it would prove our greater trouble: <hi>If our hopes were only in this life, we ſhould of all men be moſt miſerable.</hi> Indeed there is cauſe of ſorrow if they die unconverted, and breath out their Happineſs with their Lives. But for the Godly, they cannot only ſay, <hi>Dum ſpiro ſpero,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59683:33"/> While there is Life, there is Hope; but alſo <hi>Dum expiro ſpero,</hi> I have Hope in Death it ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. Death it ſelf is a Door of Hope to give them entrance into the Paradice of God, but to the Wicked a Trap-door to let them into Hell. Both Godly and Wicked ſhall change their Place, but not their Company, for they ſhall have ſuch Company they delighted in here: Thoſe that muſt leave all their Comforts behind, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they are unwilling to depart. Never had <hi>Adam</hi> more cauſe to be unwilling to leave Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> the ſtrong Holds in <hi>Sion,</hi> or the unjuſt Steward to leave his Office, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to go out of the Demoniack, when they knew they ſhould never enter there again, than a wicked Man hath to leave the World. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the Grave our long Home; <hi>Man goeth to his long home,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.5. And well he may, ſome haply may ſleep there Six Thouſand Years before the Reſurrection; but Heaven and Hell may be called ſo much better, for what is that ſpace of time to Eternity? 'Tis called alſo, <hi>The houſe of all the living;</hi> becauſe all that ever did or ſhall live, ſhall there dwell together. God hath provided all Men one Houſe in the Womb, and another in the Tomb; one when they enter into the World, and another when they go out; and the Wiſe Man tells us, <hi>The day of death is better than the day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

An Ancient Father calls the days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Martyrs ſuffered, their Birth-days, becauſe then they began to live indeed; their Marriage-day, becauſe then the Marriage was conſummate
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59683:33"/> between Chriſt and their Souls. It was an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that ſaid, <hi>Ede, bibe, lude poſt mortem nulla voluptas. But 'tis better</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) to go to the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.2. Now, through this Gate your dear Daughter is gone, and you are ſtepping after her, you are treading out her ſteps, and others ere long will do as much for you; you are but a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Clay, and begin to crack; your Pains and Aches, and Decays in Nature may mind you that you are declining, that you have one foot in the Grave, and are you troubled that another hath ſtept in before you?

Heb. 12.23. Bleſſed is that Day, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will that Union be between Chriſt and the Soul; and happy is that Man, whether he die old or young, that ſhall <hi>come to Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. Oh, what a Glorious Meeting will here be in Heaven! how Happy and Glorious will that day be, when we leave this wretched World, and wicked Company, to enjoy the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of holy and happy Saints and Angels, yea, of God himſelf bleſſed for ever. Now ſhe that formerly <hi>was in her blood, and no eye pityed

She is not loſt, but found; ſhe is but gone a days Journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and at Night you will Lodge together; you will over-take her, and find her in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Cabinet among his Jewels: She hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſtart, and is at the Race end before you, ſhe hath won the Prize; and is this matter of Grief or Rejoycing? She hath caſt her Ground, and recovered the Hill, and is at the Race end before you: You came not together into the World, and it was unlikely you ſhould leave it together. There was a probability you think ſhe might have ſurvived you, but God determined otherwiſe. Some Roſes are taken in the bud, ſome are full blown, when others wither and fall, but thoſe that grow longeſt, prove but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Flowers, and are of ſhort continuance, <hi>ſic tranſit gloria mundi.</hi> God is not engaged to ſhew us the Reaſon of his Actings, his Will is his Law, and 'tis our Duty to acquieſce in it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt his Power, and we pray his Will may be done; let us not contradict our own Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God knows beſt what is beſt, and he tells us, <hi>All ſhall work for the beſt to thoſe that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. and this may ſuffice us. If you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your own Will before his, or loved your Daughter better than your God, you cannot be his Diſciple. If you had rather enjoy her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59683:34"/> than ſubmit to God, God will take it ill from you; he took her hence when he ſaw her Work was done, and left you as yet to moil, and toil, and ſweat in the Vineyard. Submiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſtrokes is your beſt and wiſeſt courſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt his Will is fooliſh and ſinful; fooliſh, becauſe you cannot reſiſt it; ſinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ought not to reſiſt; love to God and the Creature cannot be both in the ſame Party; in the prevailing degree, <hi>we cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> 'Tis your Wiſdom rather to mind your own end, than to lament hers. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frequently minds us, and not in vain, for we are apt to forget it, of our latter end, and the brevity of our Lives: And this, if well minded, would imbitter all Earthly Enjoyments, and make us ſet a low value upon all Creature-Comforts. <hi>Man that is born of a woman,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) is of few days, and full of trouble; he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not,</hi> Job 14.1, 2.

There is but a little time between our Spring and Fall, and therefore our Lives may fitly he compared to <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, that ſprung up in one Night, and periſhed in another: Death is ſtealing upon us, <hi>tacito pede,</hi> with a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent foot, and 'tis an abſurd thing (ſaith one) to ask when we ſhall die, but rather when we ſhall make an end of dying, for every day Death ſeizes upon ſome of our Lives, and gains ground upon us, and ſteals upon us inſenſibly, as the ſhadow doth upon the Dial, till our Sun be ſet; and whether ſleeping or waking, we are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion; we are like Men under Sail, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we heed or no, we are in continual motion. Yet many that have one foot in the Grave, and the other ready to drop into Hell, <hi>yet put far from them the evil day,</hi> and under gray hairs nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh green hopes and deſires; and Young Perſons depend over-much upon their Youth: But the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proverb is, <hi>That many an old Camel carries a young ones Skin to the Market.</hi> And we ſay, A young Sheep-skin may go thither as well as the old. And Experience teacheth us, that Old Men many times carry Young ones to their Graves. Man in Scripture is compared unto <hi>Graſs, which in the morning grows up and flouriſheth, and in the evening is cut down dead and withered,</hi> Pſal. 90.5, 6.

Who would cark and care, pine and repine, when he knows not whether he have a day to live, or what ſhall be in the Womb of the next Morning? How much better is it to mind our own end, than to be troubled at anothers Death? For we muſt deny our ſelves in our Relations, if we will be the Diſciples of Chriſt. If we love any thing in the World above Chriſt, we cannot be his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; he will have the prevailing degree of our love, or he will not love us; if we lodge any thing nearer to our heart than himſelf, he will give us a Bill of Divorce, and put us away. The reſigning up our Comforts and Relations to him is the beſt way to ſecure them, for God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our Idols out of his ſight; we are his Spouſe, and have devoted our ſelves to him, and muſt hang looſe to the Creature, and ſtick faſt to him, and not break our Vows to God, made when we were eſpouſed to him, leſt we provoke him to Jealouſie by our over-fond affecting any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comfort.

Submiſſion under the Correcting Hand of God, is the ſureſt, ſooneſt way to get from under the Rod, when murmuring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining makes him double his ſtrokes; for he will either bend us, or break us; humble us, or make our hearts ake; he will bring down our ſtubborn Wills, or he will know why; for 'tis in vain for us to think to ſtruggle out of his hands, or to keep out of his reach; and indeed the World is not ſo deſirable now, neither have the Godly found it ſo heretofore: So as to deſire it for our ſelves or Relations; for though it be a Wicked Man's Heaven, 'tis a Godly Man's Purgatory, yea, all the Hell they are like to have; and who would deſire to live in Hell? When our Work is done, and our Wages ready, who would wiſh himſelf again in the Vineyard, to moil and toil, <hi>and bear the burden and heat of the day?</hi> When we are entring <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhall we again have a han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering mind after <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Onions, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Fleſh-pots, and to have our Ears bored, and be made Bond-ſlaves for ever? The World is full of the Devil's Lime-twigs, and he baits his Nets and Hooks with Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures, when he fiſhes for Souls. It may be ſaid of Poverty and Riches, as the Women in their Dances ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Poverty hath ſlain Thouſands, but Plenty Ten Thouſands. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands dye of a Surfeit: Oh how hard have many found it to guide a great Ship in a Storm and Tempeſt, when a little one can thruſt into any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Creek or Harbour? 'Tis hard carrying our Cup even in a proſperous condition; 'tis much to keep under Pride, Senſuality, Paſſion, Luxury, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and Debauchery, and other enormous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59683:37"/> ſins, which are the Worms which breed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. 'Tis not in vain that <hi>Agur</hi> prays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me; leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? Or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the Name of God in vain.</hi> A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity, a Competency, a Sufficiency without Superfluity, is the ſureſt Portion; a State too big may be as troubleſome as a Shooe too big for the Foot: 'Tis not the greatneſs of the Cage that makes the Bird ſing, neither a great Eſtate that produceth inward Joy. A Staff may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a Traveller, when a burden of Staves may be troubleſome. The Moon never ſuffers Eclipſe but at the Full. I know Poverty is a hard Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, but Abundance is more dangerous and wounding. Hence it is our Saviour Chriſt tells his Diſciples, how hard it is for a Rich Man to enter Heaven, even as hard as <hi>for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle,</hi> Matth. 19.24. The Reaſon is, becauſe 'tis hard for thoſe that have Riches to keep off their Affection from making them their God, by loving them, truſting in them, and taking them for their Portion. But this doth not always follow, ſome great Men are good Men; but many times Pride and Senſuality are the Worms that breed in the faireſt Fruit, or in the fineſt Cloath. And if Riches be ſo dangerous, what Eſtate ſhould we wiſh for our Friends? The World alſo is a Peſt-Houſe, and almoſt every one ready to infect another; and is there not cauſe to rejoyce when any of our Relations are out of the reach of the Infection? 'Tis an <hi>Egypt,</hi> not only for Slavery, Miſery, and Bondage, but alſo there is ſcarce a Houſe where there is not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59683:38"/> ſome dead Perſon in it; yea, many Families, Villages, and Towns there are where very few Spiritually alive are to be found; and who but Mad-men would delight to live among the Tombs? 'Tis a <hi>Sodom</hi> for Wickedneſs, and but a few Righteous <hi>Lots</hi> to be found in it; and their Souls alſo are continually vexed with the unclean Converſation of their wicked Neighbours. 'Tis a Raging Sea, and the Godly are Weather-beaten, and continually driven up and down by Storms and Tempeſts; and many Profeſſors here <hi>make ſhip wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience.</hi> 'Tis an Inn, where good and bad are Entertained for a Night, but the worſt Men are accounted the beſt Gueſts; and if any ſuffer, it ſhall be the Godly. The World is an Own Mother to Vice, but a Step-mother to Vertue, as the Earth is to Weeds, when it would choak the good Seed; ſo the Godly ſhould ſuffer, did not their Father look to them. Theſe are Strangers, and 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they meet with hard Uſage, and that Dogs bark at them. Happy therefore is that Perſon that hath ſafely paſt through all theſe Dangers, and is ſafely arrived at home, and got to his Journey's end. The World doubtleſs is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable for our ſelves, or our Relations, that are already paſt through the Pikes of Danger, and are out of the reach of the Devil and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and we our ſelves are preſſing hard after.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59683:38"/> ſeeing after a ſhort ſpace you will enjoy her to Eternity without interruption. Then mourn not for her, but rather rejoyce that ſhe hath left you ſo much ground of Comfort behind her; that her Life was ſuch, that ſhe lived deſired, and dyed lamented, and was not a <hi>Corazine</hi> to your heart, as many Children are to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in this Age, when they behold their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lives and Converſations, and ſometimes their untimely Death.

            <p>By theſe and the like Arguments, Madam, I have upon the like Occaſion oft-times argued my ſelf into content, and ſtilled thoſe boiſterous Storms and Tempeſts, which Paſſion and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent had raiſed in my breaſt, and brought the Controverſie between God and me to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, That God was wiſe, and I was fooliſh; and that it was much fitter for him to diſpoſe of me, and my Relations, than it was for me; and brought me to a Reſolution, to let him, who had ruled the World for ſo many thouſand Years, to Rule it ſtill. The like Conſideration had the like O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration on <hi>Job;</hi> though at firſt he had a mind to quarrel God, yet at laſt <hi>he lays his hand upon his mouth,</hi> and humbles himſelf in Duſt and Aſhes, and cries out, <hi>I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer?</hi> Theſe Meditations brought me to know that it was fitter for me to prepare for my own Death, than to bewail the Death of another; yea, made me know that it was of much more concern to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59683:39"/> take care of my Relations, while living, to fit them for their Eternal Being, than to bewail them (eſpecially thoſe I have comfortable hopes of) when dead; and to be troubled more at my own Neglects, than at God's Providence. And the Lord grant that theſe and the like Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may have the ſame or rather a better Effect upon you, to quiet your Spirit under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Providence.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, though this be neceſſary to bring us to ſubmit unto God, and bring our Wills to God's Will, and to acquieſce in what he doth, yet 'tis not ſufficient; God doth not laſh us only to make us leave crying, or to ceaſe our murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but in theſe Viſitations he hath a further deſign upon us; his Rod ſpeaks more than this unto us, he expects that his Phyſick ſhould have ſome other Operation upon us, and not only leave us as it finds us, but ſhould do us ſome good alſo; the Father beats one Child, that the reſt may beware. <hi>It was good for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I learn to keep thy commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.67.71. If God preſerve us, 'tis no great matter whether it be in Salt or Sugar; Fiſh proſper as well in ſalt as freſh Water. The Wallnut-tree, they ſay, bears beſt when moſt beaten; and I am ſure many times Chriſtians thrive beſt under Affliction: The Wind ſhaking the Tree, makes it take deeper and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Root, <hi>quae nocent docent,</hi> bitter Pills may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be as neceſſary as Sweet-meats; a Leſſon ſet on with whipping, is beſt retained; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times Correction doth what Cockering will not; and there is no doubt, whatever Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59683:39"/> God in Correcting his Children minds their good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. Theſe bitter Pills procure ſweet Health, as ſharp Winters kill Weeds and Worms; and God's Vines bear the better for bleeding, neither are they hurt when ſuperfluous branches are lopt off. <hi>Camomile,</hi> the more 'tis trod upon, the more it ſpreads; and the more the Cypreſs-tree is bowed down, the more it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. <hi>Ephraim</hi> found the benefit of Affliction, this made him Obedient, when before he was <hi>as an untamed Heifer, unaccuſtomed to the Yoak,</hi> Jer. 31.18, &amp;c. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s Priſon and Fetters, were better to him than his Crown and Scepter, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As 'tis ſaid of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſcham</hi> was a good Tutor to her, but Affliction did her moſt good. Correction with Inſtruction is ſure and ſafe, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtiſeſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him in thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 94.12. <hi>Feri domine feri</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) ſtrike me as much as thou wilt, if thou wilt inſtruct me; laſh me and ſpare not, ſo thou wilt Leſſon me. God doth chaſtiſe his People, <hi>that they may not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. God hath a double end in your preſent Viſitation, and both for good; one to ſet an end to your dear Daughter's Miſery, and the other to prepare you for Happineſs, by wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you from the World, and raiſing up your heart to Heaven, whither your Delight is gone: And happy are you if you learn this Leſſon, and wiſely improve this Providence; if you <hi>learn the voice of the rod, and of him that holds it,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah 6.9. <hi>For the rod of reproof gives wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 29.15. <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum.</hi> A Father Corrects his Child, not ſo much in Revenge for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59683:40"/> the fault done, as for caution for the future. <hi>Schola crucis, Schola lucis,</hi> The way to the Crown is by the Croſs.

Under ſuch Providences as theſe God would not have us be like unto bruit Beaſts in a Paſture, when one by one goes to the Shambles, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not. All Spectacles of Mortality, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of ſo near a concern, ſhould mind us of our latter end, and make us prepare for Death, when we ſee younger and ſtronger than we go to the Grave before us. We ſhould be like ingenious Children, when one is beaten, the other ſhould not only cry and tremble, but alſo take warning: We ſhould not blame our Father's Cruelty, but our own Folly; and if all work together for our good, why not this? Nay, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a good uſe may be made of this, and, if well improved, we ſhall have cauſe to ſay, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, It was good for us that we were afflicted.</hi> Some Grapes may be gathered from theſe Thorns, and ſome Figs from theſe Thiſtles; ſome Honey may be lick'd off theſe Briars, for God's Rod, like <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, hath Honey at the end. Senſible we muſt be of this Providence, as doubtleſs <hi>Aaron</hi> was at his two Sons deaths; but diſcontent we muſt not be. God complains, that <hi>Righteous perſons periſh, and no man lays it to heart; and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful men were taken away, and no man conſiders it,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. Some uſe of ſuch Providences we ſhould make, and get ſome benefits by theſe Tryals. Now, among the many Leſſons this Providence holds out to us, I ſhall only point
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59683:40"/> out theſe ſeven following, which if you and I can learn by it, it will be happy for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 1. From this Lecture of Mortality, your dead Daughter, we may learn the curſed Nature of ſin, which was the cauſe of her Death, and how little beholding we are to it, that thus rends one Friend out of the Arms of another; for whatever Diſtemper our deceaſed Friends dye of, ſin lies at the bottom, and ſets the Diſeaſe on work; but for ſin, 'tis probable we had never dyed. For <hi>the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. By one man's offence ſin came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all, for as much as all have ſinned.</hi> Now, ſhall we love the Tree, and hate the Fruit? Love the Cauſe, and hate the Effect? Shall we be like fooliſh Children, that hate the ſmarting Plaiſter, and conſider not the Ulcerous Sore that makes it neceſſary? We would have the Wound cured, and yet not have the Weapon drawn out, for fear of a little ſmart. Had not Sin gone before, Death had not followed; many Men love the Drunkenneſs, and hate the Surfeit. But did we ſee ſin in its own Colours, it would be worſe than the Effects, for 'tis the only Object of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite hatred; for he hates nothing but ſin, or for ſins ſake; and yet ſin ſeems lovely when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it in the Devil's Glaſs, or through his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles. If we could ſtrip the Devil himſelf of his vicious Qualities, he would return to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Angelical Glory; yea, into God's Favour, for he hates nothing he hath made. Man in his firſt Creation was made Holy and Happy, and had Power given him ſo to continue; and though
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59683:41"/> by his Conſtitution he was Mortal, yet by God's Bleſſing he had been Immortal for ought we know, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the Soul is: But by eating the Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. in all probability he had ſuddenly dyed, had not Chriſt interpoſed, and become a Surety to his Father, and ſo gained a longer Leaſe, and paid the Fine; however Man became obnoxious to Death, and dye he muſt. See how dangerous it is to play at the hole of the Aſp, and to ask Counſel at the Devil's Mouth, for ſo <hi>Eve</hi> did, and for that Offence all her Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity muſt <hi>eat bread in the ſweat of their brows, till they return to the duſt out of which they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> No Greatneſs can excuſe us, no Wiſdom can prevent it; but the moſt dangerous Death is to dye in our ſins. Sin it is that makes us uncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, otherwiſe we had been ſo armed, Death could never have entred, or pierced the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. And ſhall we hug this Viper in our Boſom, that will ſting us to Eternal Death? For ſin is the very <hi>ſting of death,</hi> without which Death were not ſo formidable. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offence diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf to all his Poſterity, as Poiſon doth to every part of the Body; and ſhall we love the Work, and hate the Wages? Actual Sin is the Fruit of Original Corruption, and ſprings from this bitter Root, and 'tis the cauſe of all our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; and ſhall we, like the fooliſh Dog, bite the ſtone, and let the Paſſenger that threw it go free? Let us turn therefore all our ſorrow into ſorrow for ſin, for all is little enough to run in this Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l. And let this be your Motive, though not one of the greateſt, ſin was the cauſe of your d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59683:41"/> if this bitter Pill have this Operation upon you, to make you hate ſin with a perfect hatred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, 'tis not only Death, but alſo all the Miſeries that accompany Life, and are the fore-runners of Death, which are the direful Fruits and Effects of Sin. Could we ſee Sin in its own proper ſhape, it would appear moſt hateful and deteſtable; but the Devil hides its Deformity from us what he can, and to this end lends us his Spectacles, in which it appears lovely and amiable; but we may beſt ſee it in the Effects. It was this that turned <hi>Angels</hi> out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, and many thouſands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell; and can the Tree be good that brings forth ſuch unſavoury Fruit? This raced out the Image of God, and engraved upon the Soul the very Image of Satan. The Devil knows well enough that if we ſaw Sin in its own Colours, we muſt needs hate it, for who can fall in Love with Deformity it ſelf? And therefore miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, as a deformed Hag paints her Face, and covers her Deformity, thereby to take her Prey, and allure unwary Youth. So the Devil deals by Sin, and repreſents it in Vertue's Colours; but the Glaſs of the Word would ſhew it in its own ſhape. Indeed there is nothing in the World that can fully reſemble it, yet in the Scripture 'tis repreſented by the fouleſt things imaginable; to filthy Ulcerous Sores, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. To the Mire that Swine wallows in, the Vomit of a Dog, to filthy Rags, Menſtruous Cloathes, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poiſon, a fretting Cancer, or Gangreen; 'tis ſo infectious, none can eſcape the Infection; it infects the whole Man, like the Leproſie in the Head, the Thoughts, Words, Deſires, Affections,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59683:42"/> and Actions, are all polluted and unclean, and ſmell of the Cask, and ſtink in the Noſtrils of God; our Eating, Drinking, Buying, Selling, Trading, yea, Plowing, is ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. And all our Religious Duties, if not performed with the Incenſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, are defiled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, &amp;c. and 66.3. Why? Thoſe Duties, though commanded by God, yet proceeding not from a right Principle, directed to a right End, and done in a right manner, muſt needs be faulty. Now ſin, though looked upon as a harmleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent thing, (and when Men have put a fair Mask upon its ſoul Face) looks lovely; and the Devil hides its ſoul Viſage, as 'tis ſaid the <hi>Panther</hi> doth his deformed Head, purpoſely to take his Prey, yet ſtill it remains ugly: Pride covers it ſelf with the name of Cleanlineſs; Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is taken for Good-fellowſhip, and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Good Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Effects are not ſo lovely, let the Devil and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſay what they will to the contrary; for 'tis the occaſion of all the Miſeries that ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel Mortal Man: We had never had aking Head, or aking Heart, or Loſs, or Croſs, or any thing to moleſt us, had it not been for ſin; yet are we apt to over-look it, and yet have our finger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Sore; we cry out, Oh my Back, my Belly, my Bones, my Heart, but ſeldom Oh my Sin; we are like h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m that complains of the pain in his Foot, but not of the Shooe that pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him; of the Gout, Stone, Strangury, Surfeit, but not of the Intemperance that is the cauſe. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cries out, Take away the Frogs, the Lice, the Darkneſs, let there be no more Hail, but not take away the Sin, the hardneſs of Heart;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59683:42"/> that brought them. God when he threatens Death for ſin, threatens alſo all the Cauſes, and Fore-runners of Death, and all the Evils which accompany a ſinful Life, for theſe are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Productions of ſin, and much worſe. Fruit it bears, if Repentance prevent it not, and like a mighty Wind blows it not down before it come to Maturity, otherwiſe it will be bitter Fruit: We have far greater cauſe to cry out, Oh my filthy Sins, Oh my Pride, my Paſſion, my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, my Deadneſs, Dulneſs, Formality, Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than Oh my dead Father, my Husband, my Son, my Daughter. We ſhould ceaſe quarrelling God, and turn the edge of our Anger, Sorrow, and Indignation againſt Sin, and againſt our ſelves for our ſin, and ſo our Quarrel will be much more juſt. 'Tis a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Child, that when corrected for a known fault, will rather quarrel his Father, than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his own Guilt. We are apt to cry out, Oh my Loſs, Oh my Croſs, than Oh my Sin, my Infidelity, my inordinate Affections, which forces God thus to Correct me. Let us remove the Cauſe, and the Effect will ceaſe. Thus you ſee, whether we conſider ſin in it ſelf, in its peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, infectious Nature, or whether we conſider it in its direful Effects, the Miſeries that attend it, we have more cauſe to bewail it, than any Loſs or Croſs that can befal us for ſins ſake, as the Cauſe is worſe than the Effect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But this is not all, for ſin procures Spiritual Judgments as well as Temporal, and theſe are far more deadly and dangerous; for theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers reach the Soul, when the other touch only the Body, or Eſtate; Sin defiles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59683:43"/> all the Powers and Faculties of Soul and Body; Sin is ſo Infectious and Contagious, and the Effects thereof ſo Malignant, that the greateſt and moſt dangerous Plague-ſore, even that which rendeth the Soul from the Body, is not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 'Tis ſin that hardens the Heart, and turns it into the Nature of a ſtone.

We had ſold our ſelves Bond-ſlaves to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and neither Man nor Angel could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us out of our Slavery, or have paid a Ranſom ſufficient for us, but Chriſt laid down his Life to free us from the guilt of ſin, from the filth of ſin, from the Puniſhment due for ſin, from the Curſe of the Law, the Wrath of God, the Slavery of Satan, and from Everlaſting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And hath he for all this deſerved our Malice and Hatred? He hath beſtowed more upon us than the World hath to beſtow; 'tis he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59683:45"/> that ſends us ſo many Ambaſſages for Peace, and rains Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> ſo plentifully about our Tents; he gives us Promiſes, ſuch as the greateſt Kings upon Earth cannot make, and make good to their greateſt Favourites, as of his Spirit, his Graces, his Son, and his Glory: And is all this nothing?

Well, we cannot make our Peace with God, till we break our League with Sin; and if God be our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (and our Enemy he will be if we are at Peace with Sin) then we may expect he will treat us as Enemies. Well may we fear that every bit of Bread we eat, will choak us, and every drop of Drink we drink, may be our bane, and that every Creature may wait for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to end our days; that the Floods may drown us, as they did the Old World, or the Fire conſume us, as <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the Earth ſwallow us up, as <hi>Korah</hi> and his Complices, or the greateſt Judgments that ever we read fell upon Mortal Man, may be our Portion.

            <p n="5">5. Nay, but this is not all, for Eternal Death as well as Spiritual and Temporal is the Reward of Sin, the everlaſting ſeparation of Soul and Body from God, which is called, <hi>The ſecond Death;</hi> and this is far greater than all the Miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

This is the Natural Fruit and Effect of every beloved ſin, even the everlaſting Damnation of Body and Soul; a thouſand thouſand rentings of the Soul from the Body, is not comparable to one renting of the Soul from Chriſt. Sin doth that for us, that all the Men on Earth, and Devils in Hell could never do, even pull us out of the Arms of God. This threw Angels out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, and Millions of Souls into Hell.

This imbitters our Lives (as you have heard) while we are in the World, and opens the Door to let us out of the World, and will open Hell it ſelf to let us in, and is the only bar to keep us from coming out. But if Sin were mortified, we might, with Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> depart in Peace; and with <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſay, I am not aſhamed to live, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye: And with <hi>Paul, I deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Death without his Sting, is like <hi>Samſon</hi> without his Hair, or like the Drone-Bee without a Sting, not terrible; he may hum, but not hurt; ſtrike, but not ſting; kill a Believer, yet not hurt him; the worſt is to ſend him to his Father's Houſe the ſooner.

               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 2. From this Lecture of Mortality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is this, It may plainly ſhew us, how little good the World will do us when we have moſt need; and by this we may take a true eſtimate of its Worth, or rather of its Vanity. We uſe to ſay, that is good that will do us good, and 'tis a Friend that will help in time of need. I am ſure the World will not, cannot do it; 'tis true, if we look upon it through the Devil's Spectacles, it will look fair, and ſo will an Old Hag in her Paint and Plaiſter, but this is the way to be egregiouſly deceived; but that there is really lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth in it, obſerve with me theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe the World can brag of, cannot prevent Death, though ſometimes it doth haſten it: The truth of this is evidently ſeen in this Providence; for had it been a vaſt Eſtate, ſumptuous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, coſtly Apparel, Men or Means, Food or Phyſick, that could have preſerved her Life, doubtleſs ſhe had not dyed; but this could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent the Diſeaſe, remove it, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Malignity of it: For when Death comes, (and come it will) it will neither be bribed nor baffled. Diſeaſes are God's Servants, when he bids them go, they go; and when he bids them come, they come; and what he bids them do, they do it, like the Centurion's Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Contra vim mortis, non eſt medicamen in hortis.</hi> If God ſtrike, the Creature cannot heal. God hath the Keys of Life and Death at his Girdle, and our way is to go to him, and neither truſt to Phyſicians, as <hi>Aſa,</hi> or to Witches, as <hi>Saul.</hi> 'Tis <hi>he that kills, and makes alive, and brings to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59683:50"/> gates of death, and back again,</hi> Deut. 32.39. 'Tis he that paſſed that Decree, more firm than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> That <hi>all men ſhould once dye, and after death come to Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. By force of this, your Daughter dyed, and ſo will you ere long. All that the Rich Man had, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19, 20. could not bribe Death one Night, neither can any Man Ranſom his Brother from Death. The Rich Cardinal <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> found it true to his ſorrow. Though Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be the greateſt Commander in the World, it will be out of Commiſſion in the World to come. Death is a perfect Leveller, it will Lodge the Poor and the Rich, the Fair and the Foul, the Young and the Old, the King and the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in the ſame Bed, without Reſpect of Perſons, let the World ſay what it will to the contrary; and Happy be thoſe that are prepared, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will prove but a Trap-door to Hell. Death regards not any, however dignified or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; the King then muſt leave his Robes, and the Beggar his Rags behind him; the Scull of the one retains no impreſſion of a Crown, nor of the other of his Slavery. Now, great Men are like Capital Letters, they take up more room, and be more gorgeouſly adorned and clad, commonly go before others, but ſignifie the ſame thing: So the greateſt ſignifies no more than a Man, and the meaneſt ſignifies no leſs. Or like unto Counters, ſome in the Account ſignifie Pounds, ſome Shillings, ſome Pence, and ſome leſs, but when they are in the Box, they are all of a value. So here, ſome paſs for Kings, and ſome for Peaſants, but when Death hath gotten them into his Box, the Grave, they are all alike.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59683:50"/> Yet how much need have great Men of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Monitor, for they are apt to forget their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? See <hi>Job</hi> 3.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some of the wiſer Heathens have accounted Mortality a great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that poor Creatures may be freed from their Miſery: And ſo doubtleſs 'tis for thoſe that are prepared for Death, for they reſt from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proverb is, That in <hi>Calvary</hi> there are Sculls of all ſorts and ſizes, Kings and Captains, Lords and Lozels; one takes no more out of the World than the other. <hi>Naked they come, and naked they ſhall go.</hi> Great <hi>Saladine</hi> had but his Shirt. Now, though Riches cannot prevent Death, yet it may haſten it. Rich Men many times are as Oxen in a fat Paſture, fitted for the Slaughter; ſometimes they are butcher'd by others for their Wealth, and many times they prove their own Butchers, and kill themſelves by Intemperance. The Sun-ſhine of Proſperity quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripens the Fruit of Sin, and when Sin is ripe, Ruine is ready. <hi>Bachus</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> opens the Door for Death to enter. Now, what good will it do to have a fair Suit of Cloathes, and a Plague-ſore under it? Or a dainty Dinner with a Surfeit? How often is Intemperance, which ends in Gouts, Surfeits, Dropſies, and ſuch-like Diſeaſes, the Fruits of a Plentiful Table? Theſe open the Door of Eternity, and light them a Candle to find the way to Death: Now, theſe are Diſeaſes Riches cannot cure. Seeing therefore the World is of ſo little uſe when we have moſt need, why ſhould we ſo greedily graſp after, and ſpend ſo much time about it, as to neglect our greater Concerns, and deſpond ſo much when we meet with diſappointments? And why ſhould we ſuffer
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59683:51"/> thoſe Vultures, carking Cares, to breed in, and feed upon our Hearts, and eat out all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Lives? What Recompence can the World make us, for all our pains, and broken ſleeps we have had upon its Account? It cannot warrant us a Comfortable Life, nor a Happy Death; nay, not one day free from pain: Let ſuch as over-greedily graſp after it, remember <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s words, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> maketh haſt to be rich, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be innocent.</hi> And at leiſure read <hi>James</hi> 5.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24. Yet conſider, 'tis not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Riches, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the over-loving of them that is dangerous; for they are not evil of themſelves, but great Bleſſings, if not abuſed, and ſome of thoſe Talents put into our hands to be improved by us; but prove dangerous when abuſed, over-loved, or over-truſted in. But ſeeing they can neither prevent Death, nor Diſeaſes, the cauſe of Death, we ſhould not put too high a value upon them, nor take them for our Portion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the World cannot prevent Death, no more can it procure a happy Life: And why? Becauſe it cannot give Content and Satisfaction to the Enjoyer of it; and how then can our Lives be Happy, when we are not content with our Condition, and ſatisfied with our preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments? Content never did, nor never will grow in the World's Garden, neither can Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be found in any thing under the Sun: If we ſeek it here, Riches will ſay, 'tis not in me; Honours, 'tis not in me; Pleaſure, 'tis not in me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can we expect the Sun in a Pail of Water? Indeed if the Sun ſhine upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we may ſee the reflexion of it, but if the Sun be clouded, all the Water in the World
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59683:51"/> cannot ſhew it. When God ſhines upon us, he may be ſeen in every Creature, if not, the World cannot ſhew him: Our Earthly Enjoyments ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do us no good, bring us no Comfort, without a Commiſſion from God; and could they ſatisfie us for the preſent, it would be but a miſerable Portion, yea, a great Judgment; for what ſhould we do at Death, when they leave us? God did never give us theſe for our Portion, but only a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>Viaticum</hi> in our Journey. Our deceitful Hearts haply may promiſe Content, had we an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> but they will deceive us, for our deſires would be enlarged from an Hundred to a Thouſand, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> till Kingdoms, yea, the World would be too little for us, as it was to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Covetous Men have a dry Dropſie, the more they have, the more they thirſt. <hi>Theocritus</hi> brings in the Cove-Man wiſhing he had a Thouſand Sheep, when this wiſh was obtained, he cries out, <hi>Pauperis eſt numerare pecus,</hi> 'Tis but a Poor Man that is able to number his Cattel. And 'tis no wonder, <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver.</hi> The World is of too baſe a Birth and Breeding to give the Soul content, for two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to Satisfaction, and both of thoſe are wanting; there muſt be Proportion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; but what proportion is there between a Piece of Gold and an Immortal Soul? It can neither feed it, nor cloath it, nor make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for Propriety, this alſo is loſt by the Fall; that which we call our own, is but lent us, and we muſt be Accountable for it: And 'tis vain alſo, for what Satisfaction can an Hungry Man take in a Pebble, or a Thirſty Man in a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59683:52"/> dry Pumice-ſtone? What Satisfaction had <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in his Riches, Honours, or Preferments, without <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s bow, or <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Nabath</hi>'s Vineyard? Something is ſtill out of Order, ſome ſtring or other out of Tune, that mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Muſick. And no wonder Content is not to be found here, for God himſelf could not find <hi>Adam</hi> a help meet for him. If we could turn a heap of Diamonds into a Spiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then it might bear ſome proportion to the Soul, which is a Spirit, but except we could change it into God, the work would not be done, for none but God can make the Soul happy. Theſe Earthly things are far worſe than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how then can they be a fit Match for the Soul? Gold and Silver, Gemms and Jewels, are but the Garbadge of the Earth, they ſeldom make bad Men good, or good Men better, but oft-times they make both worſe; they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom procure Content, for the deſire enlarges with the Eſtate, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Shooes did in the Wilderneſs with their Feet. <hi>Solomon</hi> could had nothing in them but <hi>Vanity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.14. They are like Smoak, they wring Tears from the Eyes; but draw not Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the Heart; or like Thorns, the faſter they are graſped, the deeper they wound: If God ſmile upon us, they may bring us ſome Comfort, if not, all the Gold in the <hi>Indies</hi> will do us no good, for this Coin is not currant in another World; we may as well ſatisfie an empty Stomack with Air, as a Covetous Man with Gold; for the more Wood we lay upon the Fire, the more furiouſly it burns; a Ship may ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Burden, before it be half full; and many
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59683:52"/> Men have enough to ſink them, that have not half to ſatisfie them. Content is one main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of Happineſs, but till we have God, we cannot have it. <hi>Croeſus</hi>'s Wealth, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Crowns, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> his Pleaſures, fall ſhort of Happineſs, or Satisfaction, yet many are filling bottomleſs-tubs, and rolling <hi>Syſiphus</hi> his Stone, and have <hi>Tityus</hi> his Vulture gnawing in their Breaſt; thoſe that have much of the World, have uſually much trouble with it, and ſometimes God ſpoils all the Sport, by throwing ſome handfuls of Hell-fire into the Conſcience. Reader, waſt thou ever upon thy ſick Bed, and received the Sentence of Death within thee? What warming Comforts did the World then afford thee? Nay, hath not ſometimes a pinching Pang of the Cholick, Gout, Strangury, or the raging pain of an aking Tooth, put thee by all the Comforts the World can afford? And why then ſhall we ſo much doat upon it, that can do us ſo little good when we have moſt need? Till we can fill our Barns with Grace, and our Bags with Glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Heaven out of the Earth, and God out of the Creature, we muſt never expect Satisfaction in any Earthly Enjoyment, I know Riches of themſelves are the good Gifts of God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Snares, when they are over-loved, and truſted in; 'tis not the having them, but the over-loving them is dangerous; they often prove the occaſion of Pride, Luxury, Tyranny, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The World muſt have the Head, and the Hand, but God muſt have the Heart. Set the World in its own place, and there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſend it before us to Heaven, and it will be made up into a Crown for us. <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Prayers
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59683:53"/> and Alms came up for a Memorial before God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. This is the way to make <hi>Friends with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and at the laſt day Sentence will paſs upon us accordingly. Yet are there too many Profeſſors that doat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World as much as ever <hi>Jonah</hi> did upon his Gourd, or the <hi>Athenians</hi> on <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple But theſe things are <hi>nec vera nec veſtra,</hi> they are worth little; and if they were, they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter: But there are Riches of another Nature, which <hi>nec prodi, nec perdi, nec ſurrepi poſſunt,</hi> none can deprive us of them; <hi>Bags that wax not old, a Treaſure in the Heavens, that fadeth not away.</hi> A Beggar is an unſuitable Match for a Prince, much more a bruit Beaſt; but 'tis a far more unſuitable Match for an Immortal Soul to be eſpouſed to a Wedge of Gold. When the Moon is at the Full 'tis fartheſt from the Sun, and neareſt to an Eclipſe. If the Heart be full of the World, there is no room for Chriſt; every Good is not ſuitable for every Nature, 'tis not Natural to a Man to live under Water, nor for a Fiſh to live on the dry Ground. Kingdoms may promiſe Content to carnal Hearts, but a Gracious Man cannot take up with ſuch poor things: One Dram of Grace will prove a better Portion than the World affords.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As theſe Earthly things are unſatisfying, ſo they are uncertain; and this is a certain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of their Vanity: For had we never ſo much of them, what avails it when we know not whether we ſhall enjoy them one day to an end? A Kingdom would give us little content, did we certainly know we ſhould loſe it at the Month's end, and our Lives with it; yea, Heaven
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59683:53"/> it ſelf would yield us little content, did we know we ſhould enjoy it only a Thouſand Years, and then be caſt into Eternal Torments; the thoughts of leaving it would take away all Pleaſure of Enjoying it, and would be a Hell in the midſt of Heaven. Now, all theſe Earthly Enjoyments will be ſtript from us at Death, haply ſooner, and our Death cannot be far off, and why ſhould we doat ſo much upon them? Many Thouſands in our Age have been Rich o're Night, and Poor ere Morning? Witneſs <hi>France, Ireland, Germany, Savoy,</hi> and many others. Thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi> one day (for ought we know) ſaw him the greateſt Man in all the Eaſt, and Poor, even to a Proverb. The uncertainty of theſe Earthly Enjoyments, is one of the greateſt Vanities that is writ upon them, how then can they be a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Portion for the Soul, which runs parallel with the longeſt line of Eternity? What will become of the Immortal Soul, when the Portion is ſpent? Why do Men make ſo much haſt to climb the Ladder of Promotion, ſeeing ſo many break their Necks ere they get to the top? <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may witneſs this; for King's Favourites ſtand but in ſlippery places, one day he glories in his Enjoyments, and the next day is hanging on the Gallows he made for another, <hi>Eſther</hi> 5.11, &amp;c. and 7.10. <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> one day his words were eſteemed as Oracles, and preſently after falling into Diſgrace, he hanged himſelf. This Age may produce many Examples to this purpoſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the great Ones of the World hardly obtain a decent Funeral, and what a condition is the Soul in that took the World for a Portion, when the Body is neglected, judge you? Angels cannot
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59683:54"/> help them, nor the Saints in Heaven, if they were willing, and then ſure nothing upon the Earth can do it. The thoughts of fore-paſt Pleaſures, Honours, or Treaſures, will give little eaſe to preſent Dolours, and the Wrath of God. It was ſmall comfort that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to the Rich Glutton, <hi>Son, remember in thy life-time thou hadst pleaſure, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>pain, now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> When pale-fac'd Death, like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s Hand-writing, ſhall enter our Lodging, to Arreſt us to appear before God in Judgment, before we have evened our Accounts, it will make our Joints to tremble, and our Knees ſmite one againſt another. What will the World do for us then at Judgment? They will prove miſerable Comforters, when the Earth, and all the works therein, ſhall be burnt up, where then is your confidence? Now many love Gold more than God, and Money is preferred before Mercy. Now, <hi>Paul</hi> calls this Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. And <hi>James</hi> calls i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Adultery, <hi>James</hi> 4.4. But this will prove like <hi>Achan</hi>'s Wedge to cleave the Soul aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or like his <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Garment, ſerve for a Winding-ſheet. Riches at the beſt are deceitful, like Winter-brooks, dry in Summer; or like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, miſerable Comforters. I have read of Fiſh in the River <hi>Araris,</hi> which change colour with the Moon; when 'tis at the Full, they are white, when in the Wane, black. Thus the World doth by us, when we want not, it ſmiles upon us, but when need is, it looks of another colour. There is no more proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this imaginary Felicity that the World doats up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59683:54"/> between a King upon the Stage, and a King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne; or between a liveleſs Carkaſs, and a living Man. In the midſt of all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments one hour's tormenting pain ſpoils all the Sport. At Death <hi>Riches take themſelves wings and flye away,</hi> and on whoſe Tree they will rooſt we know not. We uſually call Riches Subſtance, when 'tis but really a Shadow, an empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if we look upon it through the Devil's bewitching Spectacles, it ſeems gilded; 'tis like the Serpent <hi>Scytale,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, ſhe allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Beaſts to her by her beautiful Colours, and ſtings them to death. This made <hi>Paul be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world,</hi> and <hi>David as a weaned child.</hi> The World is but a blaze at beſt, but many times proves an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> which leads moſt Men out of the way; the beſt Account <hi>Solomon</hi> could give of it was, <hi>'Tis vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> Yet many load themſelves with thick Clay, but Death will unload them, and cover them with common Earth. Great Men a while diſturb the World, and graſp at Crowns and Kingdoms, but now <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Aſhes are contained in a little Urn; they are in the World as a Gueſt in an Inn, for a Night; they ſit at the upper end of the Table, fare of the beſt, lye in the beſt Bed, but in the Morning they have moſt to pay. We are in a Journey to Heaven, let us not fall in Love with what we ſee in our way, or ſit down at the Stile, or Bridge. <hi>Let us uſe the world,</hi> as a Traveller doth his Staff, keep it, or throw it away, as it helps or hinders us. If Riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, let us not ſet our hearts upon them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think our ſelves much the better or ſafer for them, for we know not what World we may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59683:55"/> Lodge in the next Night, or whether our Money there will be currant Coin. 'Tis all one at Death whether we have little or much, the Poor are as nigh to Heaven then as the Rich, and ſometimes better prepared. Riches are uncertain at the beſt, to the Poſſeſſors, like the Sea, ſometimes there is a Storm, ſometimes a Calm; ſometimes it ebbs, and ſometimes flows. They are like Winter Weather, very variable; we ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Clouds like Towers and Caſtles in the Air, but a blaſt of Wind comes and they are daſht into another form, for they wanted a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and ſo do many Men for their great Hopes: The Devil eaſily blows up ſuch blubs in proud Men's hearts, yea, ſuch Tumours are apt to riſe of themſelves. 'Tis obſerved that a Sick Man, a Covetous Man, and a Diſcontented Man cannot take Pleaſure in their Enjoyments; ſtill there is ſomething wanting to give content. <hi>Job</hi> was a Rich Man, but his Heart did not cling to his Riches, we ſee how patiently he ſuffered the loſs of all; <hi>He made not gold his hope, neither ſaid unto the fine gold, Thou art my confidence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 31.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Riches make no great difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, the Wether that bears the Bell, haply may be a little better cloathed, and fatter than the reſt, but is a Sheep ſtill, and little the better for the Bell. Should the Devil not only ſhew us, but alſo give us all the Glory of the World, 'tis not much worth; theſe are but Thorns that choak the Word, and make it unfruitful, the harder we graſp them, the deeper they wound us, and ere long will be wrung out of our Arms; we can find little Honey, but many Stings. But in Heaven there is Pleaſure without Pain, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59683:55"/> Treaſure which cannot be exhauſted. A Heart in Heaven is one of our ſureſt Evidences for Heaven; and a Heart ſet upon the Earth, the ſaddeſt Symptom of a Wicked Man; <hi>For where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo.</hi> Thoſe that are Friends to the World, are Enemies to God, <hi>James</hi> 4.4. And though we expect a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, it will prove but a <hi>Bochim,</hi> a place of Lamentation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the World can give little Content and Satisfaction to a Man, ſo it can do us little or no good in our great concerns here or hereafter; it can do little for the Body, and leſs for the Soul: I know the former eſpecially will ſeem a Paradox to many, who look upon Riches as the only Happineſs, and hate Poverty more than the Devil, and fear it more than Hell. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Gold cannot nouriſh us, nor keep us warm, both which are neceſſary to our well-being; we have read of ſome that have been famiſhed to Death amidſt infinite Treaſures. But it will be objected, it will buy us Food and Raiment; 'tis true, but Food cannot nouriſh, nor Cloathes keep warm, without a Commiſſion from God, and he can do it without them, as in <hi>Moſes, Elijah,</hi> and our Saviour <hi>Chriſt;</hi> neither can they prevent Pain, nor ſupport us under it: If they could, ſo many Rich Men would not labour under ſuch Tormenting Diſtempers, as the Gout, Cholick, Stone, Strangury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they do; and uſually Rich Men groan under ſuch Diſtempers moſt, and Riches cauſes them more than cures them: Yea, the raging pain of an aking Tooth, puts Rich Men as well as the Poor out of Humour, and all their Riches cannot eaſe them; the Oyl

The Poor Man's Diet feeds him as well as the Rich Man's Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Pulſe and Water did him and his Fellows, as well as Court-Junkets did the other; yea, they are as warm in their Rags as others are in their Robes: Yea, we oft-times find that Surfeits and nauceating Stomacks, are the Fruits and Effects of Plentiful Tables. As to the true and Primitive uſe of Cloathes, <hi>viz.</hi> to cover our Nakedneſs, and to diſtinguiſh the Sex, a Ruſſet Coat may ſerve as well as a Velvet Gown, or Sattin Suit. The Poor Man ſleeps as ſoundly upon his hard Bed as the Rich upon his Bed of Down. <hi>The ſleep of a labouring man is ſweet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he eat little or much,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.12. 'Tis true, his Fare is not ſo coſtly, neither are his Cares ſo great, but he can take his Reſt without Diſtemper or Diſtraction, while his Rich Neighbour, his reſtleſs Spirit, and carking Cares, read him nightly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon his Bed. I have read of <hi>Anacron,</hi> who when he was Poor was Merry and Jocund, which was obſerved by a Rich Neighbour, who ſent him two Talents, which when he had, his care to keep it, and his fears of loſing it, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted his Mind, that he could not ſleep, which after a while he obſerved, ſent back the Money, and was as Merry as before. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>He that maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi> And no wonder if with Gold Men get
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59683:61"/> Guilt, if God throws ſometimes ſome handfuls of Hell-fire into their Conſciences, and ſpoils all the Sport. In a word, many that eat their Bread in the ſweat of their brows, and are clad in their comely Ruſſet, have their Health as well, many times better than our Idle Gallants, that fare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly every day, and are cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, in whom the Effects of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drabbing do daily appear; and if ſuch like Debaucheries ſet an end to their Happineſs, and to their Lives alſo, what wonder now, if the World can do ſo little for the Body, then much leſs can it do for the Soul, for few bad Men are made good by it, and few good Men better; Men are never the better for Riches or Honour in God's Eſteem, many times the worſe, if they abuſe their Talents. Indeed the Papiſts Doctrine of Purgatory, Pardons, and Indulgences, if true, which they can never prove, give the Rich a very great advantage over the Poor; for though they dance with the Devil all Day, yet for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Money they may ſup with Chriſt at Night; or do the Devil's Work, and receive Chriſt's Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but a wonder then that ſo many Woes are denounced againſt the Rich, and ſo many Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the Poor: And ſure the Rich Glutton did not underſtand this Doctrine, nay, not in Hell, for then he would have ſent <hi>Lazarus</hi> to have told his Brethren which way to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Hell, and Purgatory alſo, by Pardons, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Maſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Doctrine was brewed and broached long after this, or elſe Chriſt would not have let his Apoſtles want Money to bring them out of Purgatory, for doubtleſs they had ſome Venial Sins as well as others. Beſides
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59683:62"/> this, Men want many things to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which are not ſold in the World's Shop, <hi>Gold tryed in the fire, white Rayment, ſpiritual Eye-ſalve,</hi> Rev. 3.18. The World deals not in ſuch Merchandize, they muſt be bought of Chriſt, for whoever thinks they are to be had elſewhere, will find his miſtake. The Image of God we have loſt in the Fall, the World cannot reſtore it; we are by Nature Enemies to God, the World cannot reconcile us; <hi>'tis not thouſands of Rams, nor ten thouſand rivers of Oyl will do it,</hi> Micah 6.7. The World is too thin a Garment to keep off the ſhowers of Divine Vengeance; we have ſins to Pardon, and <hi>none can forgive ſins but God,</hi> let the Pope ſay what he will to the contrary. The Queſtion at laſt will not be, What Gold we have, but what Grace we have? 'Tis not a Purple Robe, but the Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; 'tis not every Spot, but the Spot of God's People; not a ſpotted Face, but Chriſt's Sheep-mark will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us a ſtation on the right hand of Chriſt. We have many Spiritual Maladies, and Chriſt alone muſt be our Phyſician, and his Blood the only Potion; none but he can bind up the broken Heart, and ſpeak Peace to the troubled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We are by Nature Slaves to Satan, and the World, were it ſold to the worth of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Redeem one Soul out of his Bondage; the World indeed are the Fetters that faſten us to him, but cannot looſe us, and theſe are the Toys he allures us with, as Children are with Rattles, to be content in our Slavery. We are by Nature ſtrangers to God, and 'tis by the Blood of Chriſt, not the World's Wealth, we are brought home, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. We want Comfort, and 'tis the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59683:62"/> Spirit that is the Comforter. In our Spiritual wants we can have no ſupply, in our Diſtempers of Soul no help, at our Death no comfort from the World; it never did us much good, but at Death and Judgment can do us none, as many have too ſadly experienced. When we are lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into the infinite Ocean of Eternity, and look back upon the World which we have loved and truſted in for help, we ſhall find our ſelves miſerably cheated; the thoughts then of former Enjoyments will bring us little Delight, eſpecially if we think of the after-reckoning, and that our eaten Bread is not forgotten, and our Silks and Sattins unpaid for. When the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes, the World cannot ſupply us with Oyl, 'tis not to be Sold in this Market; neither with a Wedding-garment: It muſt be the Oyl of Grace, and the Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Jewels of his Graces muſt do our work; and this is our Miſery, all our Riches then will not pay the Debts it hath contracted, nor undo the Bonds it hath tyed. The World always ſhews moſt love where there is leaſt need, and yields us no help at the greateſt neceſſity. This may ſuppreſs our over-eager deſire after it; for if we would moil and toil, let it be in a more Fruitful Soil. Do not the Poor paſs through this Life as comfortably as the Rich, and ſometimes with more content? And think with <hi>Galeacius, All the Wealth in the World is not worth one day's Communion with God,</hi> and that may be had in the Cottage as well as in the Court. Many Treaſure up Riches, and it proves like Snow-drifts, the Sun ſhines upon it, and it melts away, and reaches not to Eternity. But there are durable Riches,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59683:63"/> other Riches before the cold Grave have their Bodies, hot <hi>Tophet</hi> hath their Souls, and their Wealth cannot ſave them; and thoſe that could never have enough, have there Fire enough. 'Tis a ſad miſtake to think Riches, Honours, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Delights, are the only Happineſs, for then Chriſt and his Apoſtles and followers had been moſt unhappy; for <hi>Silver and Gold they had none,</hi> no, not to pay Tribute. The Scripture meaſures not a Man's Happineſs by the multitude of his Riches, for ſuch may be deſtitute of Grace, and ſo is ſtill Poor in the midſt of Plenty. Who is it that would have a filthy Itch upon him for the pleaſure he takes in ſcratching? Such is an immoderate deſire after the World. Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 'tis not the having an Eſtate, but the over-greedy deſire of it, and the over-loving it, makes it dangerous; for a Man may <hi>make friends with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs</hi> for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if he improve it well, and lay it not too near his Heart. 'Tis bad putting the Poor's part into a Child's Portion, 'tis better leave a Child a Bag to beg with, than ill-gotten Goods to make up his Portion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As the Benefit the World affords here or hereafter is not great, ſo the Danger it expoſeth us to here and hereafter, is not ſmall; which, did our greedy Miſers well conſider, they would not ſo greedily graſp after it: For Riches are like Thorns, the faſter they are hug'd, the deeper they wound; yea, many times pierce to the very Heart. Of theſe Worldly things the Devil makes his choiceſt Baits when he fiſhes for Souls, and moſt Men will be nibling at them. He is like a cunning Fowler, he ſtands behind the Buſh
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59683:63"/> when he expoſeth his Baits to our view, but 'tis hard ſometimes to ſee the Hand that holds it; he ſuits his Baits to the inclination of every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he hath a Companion for the Drunkard, a <hi>Delilah</hi> for <hi>Samſon,</hi> a wedge of Gold for <hi>Achan,</hi> Honour for <hi>Haman,</hi> the World for <hi>Demas,</hi> and Money for <hi>Judas;</hi> yea, ſo confident is he that thoſe Baits will take, that <hi>All this will I give thee,</hi> he thought ſufficient to take with Chriſt himſelf; and there is but a very few eſcape him, the moſt are lull'd aſleep with thoſe <hi>Syren</hi> Songs, and it had need be a cunning <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> that eſcapes the dangers. Very many Profeſſors of Religion are led Captive, and their Affections growing warm upon the World, they grow cold upon God, for they cannot ſerve two ſuch Maſters. Who almoſt can eſcape blinding, when the duſt of Gold is blown into their Eyes? But if theſe Promiſes ſucceed not, the Devil and the World have other Weapons at hand; Threatnings, Menaces, Mocks, Scorns, Perſecutions, Priſons, Gallows, Fire, and Faggot, or if need be, more horrible Tortures and Torments, and were it in their power, Hell it ſelf ſhould not be wanting, (but God keeps the Keys of Heaven and Hell in his own hands, let the Pope ſay what he will to the contrary.) If <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Muſick will not allure, he hath a fiery Furnace to terrifie. Oh, vain World! how great an Enemy haſt thou been to thoſe that loved thee beſt, and truſted thee moſt? How many have bewailed upon their Death-bed, the time they have waſted in thy Service, and how they neglected their great Concerns to hunt But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flies, and miſtook Earth for Heaven, and the Creature for God, and all this while ſought Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59683:64"/> in a Waſp's Neſt, and Content where it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet was found? A Kingdom cannot content <hi>Ahab</hi> without the addition of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, nor that neither. Many think their Burden is never heavy enough. Miniſters that have two Steeples upon their backs, would have an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and one Kingdom is not enough for one Man: But one abuſed Talent will be found hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy enough in the Reckoning, and will ſink him down into outward Darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. It will be a ſad thought in Hell to think what a bad Bargain they made, when they ſold their Souls, their God, their Heaven, and their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, for thoſe tranſitory, deceitful, fading, gilded Nothings, which they had in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
            <p>The World deals by the Soul, as by the Body; Riches oft makes the Body ſo Nice, it cannot endure Hardſhip, but it takes Cold; and 'tis much ado to converſe with the World, and not have our Affections cool as to Heaven. Froſt and Snow are good for the Seed, though the Flowers like it not. The Devil lays ſo many Snares in the way, that he prevails with the moſt to abuſe their Talents, to future their Repentance, and fool away their Salvation; and ſuch duſt-heaps are in every corner. The World may and muſt be uſed; but abuſe it we muſt not, and abuſed it is when it promotes Pride, Luxury, Gluttony, or Drunkenneſs, Sloth or Idleneſs, Chambering or Wantonneſs, Cruelty or Oppreſſion, or any other Luſt of the Fleſh; but of ſuch Servants that abuſe their Talents the World is full, and Hell alſo; but their Glaſs will be run out, when they think 'tis but newly turned; and their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59683:64"/> Maſter will come before they expect him, and give them a Reward. Proſperity doth not at all facilitate the work of Converſion, but frequently doth retard it. 'Tis hard for Rich Men to be crucified to the World, and the World to them; and therefore Chriſt in his time obſerved that it were the Poor that received the Goſpel; and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>not many great men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> And many woes are denounced againſt the Rich up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account; they lye under more Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than others do, and had need of a great meaſure of Grace to withſtand them, and Self-denyal to reſiſt them. Many in a low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have ſtrained at Gnats, who, when Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes, have ſwallowed Camels: See this in <hi>Hazael.</hi> I know Poverty hath its Temptations alſo, and therefore <hi>Agur</hi> prays againſt Poverty and Riches. An Eſtate too big is as troubleſome as one too little, as a Shooe too big is uneaſie. A ſmall Ship in a Storm can thruſt into a little Creek or Harbour, where a great one cannot ride. He that is on the top of the Ladder of Promotion, will have a worſe fall if his Foot ſlip, than he that ſtands on the Ground. 'Tis not the greatneſs of the Cage that makes the Bird ſing, nor the greateſt Eſtate that makes a Man always moſt content; but the Piece that God cuts us, and the Portion he gives us, is doubtleſs beſt for us, whatever our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urmuring Hearts ſay to the contrary. The Grain of Riches oft breeds the Vermin of Pride, Luxury, and Senſuality; thoſe that are full fed, oft wax wanton, and are oft dipping in the Devil's Sauce. Riches are ſuch blocks in Heaven's way, that many oft-times
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59683:65"/> ſtumble at them, and never riſe again. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. cheapen Heaven, but when he knew the rate, he went away without it. Hence 'tis Rich Men hardly go to Heaven, they have a Clog at their heels. Self-denyal to great Perſons is not eaſie, and where it is, the Croſs is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. Rich Men's ſhoulders are too tender to bear a heavy Burden; but there is ſeldom any paſſage <hi>à deliciis ad delicias, à Coeno ad Coelum,</hi> we cannot receive Chriſt's Wages for doing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Work; no leaping out of <hi>Delilah's</hi> Lap into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; there are but a few Stars of the Firſt Magnitude ſhine in this Hemiſphere, yet ſome there are. 'Tis not the having Riches, but the loving them, that is dangerous; not the uſing the World, but the abuſing it, that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; 'tis <hi>he that maketh haſt to be rich, that cannot be innocent,</hi> Prov. 28.20. Many Rich Men are like Children, that having both their Hands and their Mouths full of Meat, yet will part with none; but the Poor Man's Box would be their ſafeſt Repoſitory, for that is not given but lent to the Lord, when what is kept will be loſt. The Vertigo is not ſo dangerous to thoſe that ſtand low, as to thoſe that climb high. Many Men have their Heads turned by too much Drink, never by too little; and many a Man ſells his Soul for Riches, never for Poverty; Riches are <hi>the thorns that choak the Word,</hi> and 'tis hard hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe Thorns, and not be prickt by them. Now, if they are ſo uncertain, and of ſo little uſe, why ſhould our Affections run out ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately upon them? Great Men 'tis true, make a great ſtir and bluſter in the World for a ſeaſon, and then their Place ſhall know them no more,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59683:65"/> and their Wealth and Honours ſhall be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>Sic tranſit gloria mundi.</hi> Time with his Sithe moweth down as well the Lillies of the Crown, as the Graſs of the Field: Every days Experience checketh the fond conceit of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, when many of our Youthful Gallants drop into their Graves before they are aware, as Men in a Snow drop into a Pit before they ſee it; and except Repentance prevent it, their Souls will lye in Hell, as Grapes in a Wine-preſs, or Pickled Herrings in a Barrel, (as one ſaith) or as Lime-ſtones or Tiles in a Kiln to be burnt. The greateſt Men are but as Paſſengers in an Inn, the Goods they enjoy are but lent them for a Night, and they may ſay of them, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Ax, <hi>Alas, Maſter, for it is borrowed.</hi> We ſhould uſe theſe things as a Traveller doth his Staff, which he keeps or throws away, as it proves a help or an hindrance to him. When we go to Bed, we know not but we may wake in Eternity next Morning, and then whoſe are theſe? We ſhould think never the better of our ſelves, neither think we are the ſafer for them, for they cannot better or ſecure us; for what World we ſhall be in to Morrow we know not, and then it will not be much to us whether we leave Poverty or Riches behind us. Riches may make us more unwilling, often more unfit to dye: They are like to Winter Weather, variable and uncertain; or like the Sea, ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a double uncertainty always accompanies them; they may be taken from us, or we from them; ſometimes our hopes are great, and then ſoon daſh'd: Yet how ſoon can the Devil blow up the bubble of Pride with the wind of Vain-glory?

A Covetous Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Rich, nor a contented Man Poor; thoſe that have God for their Portion, want nothing; and thoſe that have not, have nothing that is truly neceſſary.

In the World we find a little Honey, and many Stings; a little bitter-ſweet Pleaſure, and much Pain; but in Heaven there is Treaſure worth the enjoying, <hi>And rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at God's right hand for evermore.</hi> And a Heart in Heaven would be a good Evidence for Heaven; if we love Pleaſure, we ſhall enter into our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Joy; here Pleaſure will be without mixture, meaſure, or end; if Riches be deſirable, here are true Treaſures; if we ſell all to buy this Pearl, we make a good Bargain; here we may have <hi>Wine and Milk without money, and without price;</hi> here is no danger of coveting too much, the more we covet, the more we ſhall have; a true deſire is the required condition of Enjoyment; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we love Heaven, the better God loves us: We are in continual danger of loſing the the things of the World, but Heaven cannot be loſt if once made ſure. In a word, the World daily expoſeth us to the wrath of God, and the pains of Hell, and the loſs of Heaven. See then, all theſe things conſidered, whether the World be of ſo much worth, as 'tis uſually taken to be, and whether
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59683:67"/> it be worth the Care, Induſtry, Pains, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence we uſually beſtow upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 3. The ſhortneſs of your Daughter's Life, the ſuddenneſs and unexpectedneſs of her Death, teach us alſo the worth of Grace, and the neceſſity of a good Conſcience; for theſe are the neceſſary Qualifications to fit us for Death, and to give us an Intereſt in Glory: We know neither the day nor the hour when our Lord and Maſter cometh, and woe to us if we are found unprepared. This Oyl muſt not be wanting when the Bridegroom comes, nor the Wedding-Garment at the Marriage-Supper. If a bare Profeſſion of Religion would ſerve turn for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then Chriſt's Flock would not be a little one; but <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> There are many in the World, that, like <hi>Uriah,</hi> carry Letters with them of their own Condemnation. For if Religion be not good, why do they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it? If it be, why do they not Practice it? The Lamps of Profeſſion without the Oyl of Grace, will not ſerve turn; 'tis but <hi>ſparks of their own kindling, and notwithſtanding theſe, they will lye down in ſorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50.11. Chriſt muſt be apprehended by Faith, and honoured by a Holy Life, by all thoſe that ſhall enjoy him: He came to ſave us from ſin, as well as from Hell, and never changeth the Relation, but he changeth the Nature and Diſpoſition alſo; and is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sanctification, as well as of Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. For this Golden Chain cannot be broken: There is nothing but the Life of Grace, and the Death of Sin, can make us fit for the Life of Glory; for if Sin dye not before us, we muſt dye eternally. Now, we know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59683:68"/> we have a day to live, or what may be in the Womb of the next Morning; and is it not then time to look about us, whether we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to dye or no? We uſually prepare for a Journey before hand, eſpecially if it be long; and for a Fair or Market, before it comes. The Souldier will not Encounter his Enemy without his Armour; and dare we grapple with Death unprepared, who is the King of Terrors, and a Terror to Kings? We have not Fleſh and Blood to wraſtle with, but <hi>Principalities and Powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places,</hi> Epheſ. 6.11, 12. And 'tis a thouſand times better to meet an Enemy without Armour, than Death without Grace. Now, this is our time to get Grace, and we know not how ſoon the Market will be over, and <hi>Night come, when no man can work.</hi> Upon this little Inch of Time depends Eternity, our Everlaſting well as ill Being. The greateſt Weights hang upon the ſmalleſt Wyers. Grace, though it cannot p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Paul, deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And though Grace now be diſreſpected, it will prove the beſt Flower in the Garland, and the moſt Orient Pearl in the Crown. This is the Key that muſt let us into Heaven, when the World will prove a Bar to keep us out; it will prove a Comfort at Death, when the World will prove but Vexation. Grace and Peace were the choiceſt Jewels the Apoſtle could wiſh to thoſe he loved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures are not of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59683:68"/> ſo great a value, but others are not of this mind. The pleaſed Face of God cannot be ſeen but in this Mirrour; when all other things vaniſh into ſmoak, this will endure; this fetches Water from the Fountain, Light and Heat from the Sun, and all that good is comes in at this Door. Sin is the only Make-bate between God and the Soul, and Grace the Reconciler. Now, that I may ſhew you ſomething of the worth of Grace, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, I beſeech you obſerve well theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Grace and a good Conſcience are abundantly uſeful and neceſſary even in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Life, as well as hereafter, to carry us through the World with comfort and content, which cannot otherwiſe be had, and miſerable are thoſe that want it, however they may dream they are happy. Many are the Troubles we meet with here, and 'tis Grace that keeps the Heart from ſinking under them: The moſt pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calamity, and the moſt ſmart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Rod are by Grace chearfully endured. <hi>Many are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the righteous, but the Lord will deliver them out of all;</hi> but 'Tis Faith muſt ſuck ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from this and the like Promiſes: But what Comfort flows hence to thoſe that have not Faith? A Godly Man knows, <hi>Through many tribulations he muſt enter into heaven.</hi> What is this to wicked Men, when they ſhall be violently thrown through theſe Briars and Thorns into the Pit of Hell. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>It is well for me that I was afflicted,</hi> Pſal. 119.71. It was a Furnace to refine him, and purge away his Droſs, but where it meets with nothing but Droſs, it will conſume. Fiſh will live and grow beſt in cold and ſalt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59683:69"/> Waters; and 'tis ſaid of the Wallnut-tree, the more 'tis beaten, the better it bears; and of the Camomile, that it ſpreads beſt, when 'tis moſt trod upon; ſo do God's Vines, the more they are pruned and prickt, and made to bleed, <hi>quae nocent docent,</hi> a Leſſon ſet on with whipping, is beſt remembred. But obſerve, there muſt be Life in the Fiſh, before they can grow; and in the Trees, before they can bear; and in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, before they can thrive by Affliction: Hewing may make a Tree fitter for the Fire, but not more fruitful, if it have no Life. Affliction makes a good Man better, but a bad Man worſe, who are under the Rod <hi>like wild Bulls in a net,</hi> Iſa. 51.20. Impatient, and Turbulent, Swearing, Ranting, and Blaſpheming, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9, 10.21. Clear Water, when 'tis ſhaken in a Glaſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains clear, but if there be Mud at the bottom, ſhaking diſcovers it; the rottenneſs of the Lungs diſcovers it ſelf by the breath, and if there be rottenneſs at the Heart, it will appear by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury belches at the Mouth. Holy <hi>Job</hi> was not of this Humour, he is the ſame in Proſperity and Adverſity; on the Throne, and on the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; for he bleſſed God for taking away, as well as for giving, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. A Believer is ſatisfied Affliction cannot ſeparate him from God, and then he fears not any other ſeparation. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> can ſing in a Priſon, when many a Man trembles in a Palace. <hi>Philpot</hi> and his fellows can be as merry in the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Cole-houſe, as the Biſhop can be in his Bed of Down. God and a good Conſcience are good Companions in a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſon, and a guilty Conſcience is a bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in a Palace, as <hi>Nero</hi> and many others
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59683:69"/> have experienced. Grace made <hi>Daniel</hi> venture boldly on the Lion's Den, and the three Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies upon the Fiery Furnace, and was <hi>David</hi>'s Comfort at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> in his Troubles went to the Witch, or rather to the Devil for help. And as Grace and a good Conſcience bear up the Head above Water in Affliction, when others ſink, ſo alſo it bears up the Heart againſt Reproaches, and is a ſpecial Antidote againſt the Poiſon of Venemous Tongues, and indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sincerity can do it; this beats back the Reproaches into the Reproacher's Face, and helps to caſt this Burden on the Lord, as knowing in due time he will clear the Innocent, and will not let the Guilty go free. Now, Reproaches is a Burden, that thoſe of whom the World was not worthy, had a ſhare, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. and the beſt of Men had a portion; and ſome drink very deep of this Cup, as <hi>David, Jeremy, Amos, Eliſha, Iſaiah,</hi> yea, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.14. And none on this ſide Hell have ſuffered more of this kind than the Godly have done, and none on this ſide Heaven have born it better, and it is Grace that enables them ſo to do. Innocence is no Target againſt Calumny, <hi>Contra Sycophanti morſum non eſt remediam,</hi> no Shield againſt the back-bitings of a ſlanderous Tongue, but Grace it is that keeps the Poiſon from the heart. In the Primitive Times, and in later days, none have been more reproach'd than true Chriſtians, that <hi>Machiavilian</hi> Principle hath been exactly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, <hi>Calumniare audactis aliquid ſaltem adhaerebit,</hi> Reproach freely, ſomething will ſtick; if the Wound be cured, the Scar will remain: But Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Innocency Triumphs in the Conſcience of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59683:70"/> their greateſt Accuſers, and they can ſay as <hi>Job, Till I dye, I will not leave my Integrity,</hi> Job 27.5, 6. If there be fair Weather within, no matter what Storms are without; if the Bird in the boſom ſing ſweetly, no matter what others ſay or ſwear. Chriſt himſelf, though free from Sin, yet was not free from Reproach; he was called a Drunkard, a Glutton, a Companion of Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a Blaſphemer, one that was a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and had a Devil, and <hi>caſt out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>the Prince of the Devils;</hi> they buffered him, ſpit in his Face, and mocked him. But a good Conſcience wipes off all theſe Reproaches, and caſts them back into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher's Face, and 'tis better than a Thouſand Witneſſes, either in accuſing, or excuſing; if Conſcience Accuſe, the World cannot Juſtifie; and if it be clear, no matter though all the World condemn us. In this caſe of falſe Accuſation, Chriſt bids us <hi>rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, for great will be our reward in heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.11, 12. When the Apoſtles were beaten before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>they went away rejoycing, that they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt,</hi> Acts 5.41. They knew this would add weight to their Crown of Glory; and would not accept of Deliverance, like thoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> for want of Grace, under far eaſier Tryals, hang'd himſelf: Grace makes Men truſt God when De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is out of ſight, when others cannot; for while their chiefeſt Treaſure is ſafe, they are well enough; they know if they loſe all for Chriſt, they ſhall loſe nothing by him; but <hi>ſhall have in heaven a more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> They can live upon their Faith, and upon their Hope,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59683:70"/> when all things elſe fails them, like the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18. Though all outward things fail, yet the Heart eſtabliſhed with Grace will not down; they know <hi>there is Balm enough in Gilead,</hi> and Oyl enough in the Horn of their Salvation. And though the Pipes are cut, there is Water enough in the Fountain; though the Creature cannot help, the Creator can; <hi>His hand is not ſhortened, that he cannot ſave, nor his ear heavy, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Grace is the whole Armour of God, wherewith we grapple with Sin, the World, and the Devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.13. The <hi>Shield that beats back the fiery darts of Satan:</hi> A <hi>Catholicon,</hi> an Univerſal Medicine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Maladies, of Soul, or Body: And as it helps us to bear all Burdens, ſo 'tis a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which we are fit for no Relations, no Offices or Places, in Church, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; nor to perform any Duty to God, or Man: Though Grace cannot fit every Man for every Office, <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> yet 'tis ſuch an Ingredient, without which a Man is fit for no Place, neither can he perform the Relative Duties of any; ſuch an <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, Grace being ſo neceſſary in the whole courſe of our Lives, let us above all gettings, get Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, if Grace be ſo neceſſary in the Affairs of this Life, then doubtleſs 'tis much more uſeful in the concerns of another, when nothing elſe can ſtand us in ſtead. If it will fit us to live,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59683:71"/> it will much more fit us to dye, and to leave the World; it will bear up the heart under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apprehenſions of Death it ſelf, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the heart againſt the venemous Darts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and keep the heart from deſponding under the apprehenſions of it. When Gold and Silver, Gemms and Jewels will do little good, a Man armed and fortified with Grace, will dare to meet this Enemy in the Field, and treat him as the Apoſtle doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> &amp;c. The braveſt Challenge (ſaith one) that ever rang in Death's Ear; for when the Heart is defended with this Shield of Grace, no venemous Dart can ever pierce it; the ſting is to ſuch taken out, and they may put the Serpent into their Boſom; 'tis a conquered Enemy, lying proſtrate at their Feet; or rather an Enemy to Nature, but a Friend to Grace; the ſame blow that kills the Body, ſets the Soul at Liberty. Now, he that hath his Soul garniſhed with Grace, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience purged from dead works. He that hath aſſurance of the Pardon of his Sin, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, in Heaven, and Glory, he will not be daſh'd out of Countenance with the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged looks of Death. He that hath on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Garment, needs not fear when he is called to the Supper. He that hath Oyl in his Veſſel, as well as a Lamp in his Hand, needs not fear the coming of the Bridegroom, nor the Servant that is watching, when his Lord comes home. Death may kill a Godly Man, but cannot hurt him; the worſt it can do, is but to ſend him to his Father's Houſe the ſooner.

Some cluſters of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Grapes we meet with in the Wilderneſs, which makes us long to go over <hi>Jordan.</hi> 'Tis true, no Man loves Death for its own ſake, neither can he, it is an Enemy to Nature; but when a Believer knows the only way to Paradice is under Death's Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword, and the only way to be freed from all Sorrow, is to ſuffer a little Pain; that one blow will free him from Sin and Sorrow, the Devil's Temptations, and the World's Allurements, and ſet him out of the reach of all his Enemies, even in the Boſom of Chriſt himſelf. Who would be afraid of ſuch a blow? Or who would fear the time when his loving Father ſhould ſend a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger for him, out of a troubleſome World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternal Happineſs, to wipe all Tears from his Eyes, and drive all Sorrow from his Heart? Can thoſe that really believe <hi>there is a reward for the righteous,</hi> and that they are of that number, fear the time when they ſhall enjoy it? Can the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner after a dangerous Storm fear to enter into the deſired Port, or a Priſoner to enjoy his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or a Sick Man his Health, or a Weary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59683:73"/> Man his Reſt? Let thoſe that enjoy their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Treaſure, and Promotions only for term of Life, fear the Expiration of their Leaſe, whoſe Lives do only defer their Torments: Let thoſe, I ſay, fear Death, and well they may, and did they but know the ſequel, it would ſend them trembling to their Graves. But I fear many that yet have honeſt Hearts, yet live at ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that they would willingly ſpin out the thread of their lives to a great length, before they were willing to dye, though it were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many Troubles, many of them under pretence they are not yet prepared, the more ſhame for them; is not their main Work done? Why then do they not ſet about it? What have they done all this while? If God ſhould add Twenty Years more yet to their days, will not this be their Excuſe then alſo? And think you, God will be thus put off? And is it not a ſad thing, that the main Concern ſhould be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and time found for every thing elſe? But for wicked Men, there is no cauſe why they ſhould deſire Death, nay, great reaſon why they ſhould dread it, as the worſt of Evils; they leap but out of the Frying-pan into the Fire, out of a Temporal Miſery, into Eternal Torments; and by haſtning their Death, out-run their Happineſs, and fall into endleſs Miſery, which comes faſt enough without haſtning. But many of thoſe mind no more their Eternal Concerns, than the Ox that periſheth: Theſe Men either think Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not neceſſary, or elſe that they have time enough to repent in, but ere long they will be ſadly convinc'd of their miſtake. Many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Death by their Intemperance, which yet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59683:74"/> they fear more than God himſelf. But to let theſe paſs, I would have Believers be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Death, than to fear it, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeparate them from the love of Chriſt; and thoſe that have the Riches of Aſſurance, cannot fear Death greatly, knowing <hi>when this earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhall be diſſolved, they have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens.</hi> And who will not part with Rags, for Robes, with a Cottage, for a Crown, and with a handful of Muck, for a handful of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? Now, this Aſſurance is the Top-Gallant of Faith, the Triumph of Truſt, and the Sweet-meat of the Feaſt of a good Conſcience, where there are many dainty Diſhes, but this is the Banquet; 'tis Heaven upon Earth, and ſuch a Jewel no wicked Man upon Earth can know the worth of it, any more than <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Cock did of the Precious Jewel. When the love of Chriſt warms the Heart, it raiſeth the deſires of ſtricter Union and Communion with him, and a fuller Enjoyment of him, which will never be ſatisfied till the full fruition in Glory. He that loves God better than Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will part with theſe for his ſake. If we hate Hell, we ſhall not ſo earneſtly deſire to live in the Suburbs of Hell. We complain of Sin, and well we may, it being the cauſe of all our Miſery; but did we hate it as we ought to do, we ſhould be willing to dye, that we might be rid of it; for when we enter through this ſtrait Paſſage, and narrow Way, we ſhall leave this and all other Burdens behind us. We pretend we would ſerve God without Diſtraction, and ſhall we fear the time and place, when and where it can only be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59683:74"/> done? But till Grace be in the Heart, Heaven it ſelf cannot be deſirable; the Employment, the Company, and Society cannot pleaſe a Wicked Man. But Grace enables a Man to ſee that Death it ſelf cannot break the Marriage-Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Soul, but then the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will be fully conſummate; and when the Soul is ſeparated from the Body, it ſhall by the Angels be carried into the Boſom of Chriſt, where ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more. Thoſe that are ſufficiently ſatisfied of the vanity of the World, the emptineſs of the Creature, the fulneſs of Chriſt, and the worth of Heaven, we cannot rationally imagine but they will be willing to part with one, to enjoy the other; in Earth we ſhall never meet with Content, or Satisfaction; in Heaven we ſhall meet with no Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Troubles, or Vexations; will a Wiſe Man chooſe a Priſon, or a Peſt-Houſe for his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if he might have a Palace? Or any but a Mad-man dwell among the Tombs? The World is all this, and much more: He that looks upon the World as an Enemy, and the Body but a Skreen between God and the Soul, will not be unwilling to have both removed: Will not a ſick Man deſire his Health, and an hungry Man his Meat, a Captive his Liberty, and a Souldier the Victory, the Husband-man the deſired Harveſt, and the Labourer his Wages? And why then ſhould not Chriſtians long for the time when they ſhall receive at God's hand the promiſed Reward, for all they have done, and ſuffered, for the ſake of God? Shall thoſe that have done and ſuffered ſo much for Heaven, now be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have it when offered? The Aſſurance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59683:75"/> of Eternal Life may make us willing to leave theſe our Temporal Enjoyments. Well then, you ſee though a ſmall meaſure of Grace cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all Difficulties, yet there is nothing elſe but Grace can fit us for Death, or enable us to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with it: And therefore above all gettings, get Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, Grace is ſuch a Qualification, that without it we can neither pleaſe God, nor enjoy Him, who is our Chiefeſt Happineſs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Theſe are the Ornaments of a Chriſtian, the Gems and Jewels that make him lovely in the ſight of God, the <hi>Gold tryed in the Fire, the white Raiment, the Spiritual Eye-ſalve,</hi> which God adviſeth <hi>Laodicea</hi> to buy of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. greater Riches than the <hi>Indies</hi> can produce: Chriſt and Grace go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he that hath one will have the other alſo; without Grace all our Duties are worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, abominable Sins; for how can pure Water come from a polluted Fountain? The Heart by Nature is an <hi>Augean</hi> Stable, full of Filthineſs, but <hi>without Holineſs we ſhall never ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. We may faſt and pray, and give Alms with the <hi>Phariſee, Mat.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with thoſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God will not regard us; though it be commanded Duties, if they proceed from a rotten Heart, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for a by end, <hi>the Sacrifices of the Wicked are an abomination to God:</hi> The Incenſe of the Wicked ſtinks of the Hand that holds it, their Good Words are uttered with a ſtinking Breath, though they may be materially good, they are formally evil; a good Motion cannot proceed from a ſoul Mouth, theſe men deny in their Lives what
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59683:75"/> they profeſs with their Lips; they are like the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> black all but the Mouth; ſome of them are fair Profeſſors, but foul Livers, <hi>dicta factis crubeſcunt,</hi> their Practice ſhames their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: You may ſee how ſuch Men's Sacrifices are accepted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2, 3. The Fountain muſt be cleanſed, or the Streams cannot be ſweet; the Tree muſt be good, or the Fruit will be bad: Whatever proceeds from a Wicked Man, ſmells of the Cask. If the Heart be right, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Pence for Pounds, Mites for Millions; and eſteems a Man as good as he truly deſires to be, <hi>Dat bene dat multum, qui dat cum munere vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> God loves a chearful giver, and eſteems the willingneſs of the Mind, before the worth of the Work; the more of the heart is in the Sin, the worſe; but the more of it is in the Duty, the better, God loves no heartleſs or grumbling Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; <hi>My ſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. <hi>David</hi>'s intention to build God an Houſe, was accepted, as if he had done it. So in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Offering his Son, the Widow's two Mites, were accepted, as if it had been an Hundred Pounds. But if Grace be wanting, <hi>though a man give all his goods to the poor, and his body to be burned,</hi> it is not accepted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Hypocrites blow their Gifts as Butchers do their Meat; yea, they are Fly-blown till they ſtink again, but Grace is the Salt that makes it ſavoury; Grace is the beſt Evidence we have for Heaven, and a ſure ſign of God's Favour, for he will know them well he beſtows it upon. <hi>He that believes and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believes not, ſhall be condemned,</hi> Mark 16.16. God gives Crowns and Kingdoms ſometimes to the worſt of Men,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59683:76"/> but the Childrens Bread they ſhall not have, the reſt is but Crumbs to feed the Dogs, or rather the Cattel for the Slaughter; <hi>No man knows Love or Hatred by theſe things.</hi> The Sun ſhines as hot upon the Bramble in the Deſart, as on the Cedar in <hi>Libanus;</hi> the Snow falls as well on the choiceſt Garden, as on the Wilderneſs; yea, the lofty Pine meets with more Storms than the Shrub; the Sun riſeth upon the Good and the Bad, and the Rain falls on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt; Wealth and Honour are handed out to the one, and to the other, and the worſt have of the beſt ſhare, and no wonder 'tis their All: Sometimes the Bramble is preferred before the Vine, the Olive, and the Fig-tree; but Grace is the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Badge, Chriſt's Sheep-mark, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any but his own Sheep did ever wear: This makes a Man better, when the World makes him worſe; this makes the heart chearful, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things make it ſad, or ſordid; yet the World contemns it, as <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Cock did the Precious Stone. But at Death if this be wanting, the Door will be ſhut againſt us; and when we are lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into the infinite Ocean of Eternity, we ſhall be glad of ſuch a Pilot. This Garb I know is out of Faſhion with our Gallants, but 'tis more durable than their Silks and Sattins, and will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter keep out a ſhower of Divine Vengeance than thoſe; it will prove the beſt Flower in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the richeſt Jewel in the Crown. The Rich Glutton would have changed his Garb with Poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and been contented with his Bill of Fare. Were the Mountains Pearls, and the Rocks Rubies, and the whole Globe of the Earth were a ſhining Chryſolite, yet Grace excels it all;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59683:76"/> Crowns and Kingdoms, ſtately Buildings, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, and Ten Thouſand Rivers of Oyl, will not reach the worth of Grace; this it is that opens the Door to the Pearl of great Price, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45. <hi>To the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. It ſupports the Heart better than the choiceſt Cordials, and thoſe that now moſt deſpiſe it, will ere long moſt earneſtly deſire it. When Death, like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s Hand-writing, enters their Lodgings, and Summons them to Judgment; when they ſhall <hi>wiſh the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them,</hi> then Grace would be the beſt Security. This is the only Ticket will open Heaven-gate, the Evidence for our Title there: To a Gracious Man, though the way be rough, the Journey's end will be eaſie; though the Battle be ſore, the Conqueſt will be certain, and the Spoils great; if they have a bad Dinner, they will have a joyful Supper; if they loſe their Eſtate, they are going to better Riches; they cannot want that have God for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above for their Mother, Chriſt for their Head and Husband, the holy Angels and glorified Saints for their Brethren and Companions, and Heaven for their Inheritance. God hath ſet his Seal, his Sheep-mark upon them, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord, Zech.</hi> 14.20. Where God changeth the Relation, he changeth the Nature and Diſpoſition; a heart in Heaven is one of the ſureſt Evidences for Heaven; <hi>For where the treaſure is, there will the heart be alſo.</hi> The beſt Treaſure the World affords, what is it but the Guts and Garbage of the Earth, the greater load of it we carry, the greater clog it oft-times proves in our Journey to Heaven, we cannot paſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59683:77"/> the ſtrait Gate till we unload it. Many make Gold their God, and their Wedge their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but it failed <hi>Achan,</hi> his Wedge of Gold did ſerve to cleave his Soul aſunder, and his <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> Garment proved his Winding-ſheet. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is called Idolatry, becauſe Men Idolize their Wealth; and Adultery, becauſe they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute themſelves to it, and lodge it in the room of God. Oh, how good is that Counſel, that bids us <hi>provide bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens, that fadeth not away,</hi> Luke 12.33. Other things we cannot keep, and if we could, they would not avail us: But the true Treaſure we cannot loſe, 'tis durable as the days of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and will run parallel with the longeſt line of Eternity. When others therefore graſp for Gold, let us graſp for Grace; for Godlineſs will be found great gain, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>But thoſe that make haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent,</hi> Prov. 28.20. 'Tis not Gold; but Grace; not Money, but Righteouſneſs, makes the Soul Rich. A Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if many Men's Hearts were anatomized, we might find the World there fairly Engraven, and nothing of Heaven would there be found. The Devil holds his black Hand over moſt Men's Eyes, that they cannot ſee the way to Heaven; and when they are blind-folded, he leads them, as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> did the <hi>Syrians</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> when they think they are going to <hi>Dothan;</hi> they come to Hell with hopes of Heaven in their mouths: They are like ſoft Wax, he can turn them into any ſhape. But Grace is the Soul's Ballaſt, that keeps
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59683:77"/> it ſteady, and elevates it above the World, and gives it a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of Glory; it mounts it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> where 'tis transfigured with Chriſt, and its Garments made white and ſhining. It gives the Soul thoſe true Beauty-Spots, which makes her lovely in the Eyes of her Husband; But theſe differ from the Devil's Patches, <hi>whoſe ſpot is not the ſpot of God's people,</hi> Deut. 32.5. Grace is the Oyl that makes her Chariot-wheels move ſwiftly, and keeps her Lamp of Profeſſion burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Many are the Promiſes God hath made to Grace in general, and to the ſeveral Graces in particular, both of things concerning this Life, and that to come; and many are the Priviledges gracious Souls have in poſſeſſion, and much more ſhall have in reverſion; and many are the Love-Tokens her Husband ſends her, and many a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Viſit he affords her. 'Tis true, ſometimes to try her Love, he hides himſelf behind the Wall, but then every ſigh, and groan, and ſorrowful complaint goes to his Heart; and when he hath tryed her Affection, diſcovers himſelf again; he promiſes, and will make it good, <hi>he will never leave her, nor forſake her; that ſhe ſhall want nothing that is good, and all things ſhall work together for her good.</hi> Sometimes indeed Phyſick is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as Food, and Affliction is the beſt Tutor, <hi>David</hi> found it ſo; if they bear ſcars for his ſake, he will change them into Beauty-ſpots; if he frown upon them, <hi>'tis but for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will he remember them; weeping may continue for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> Grace makes both the Perſon and Performances pleaſing to God, 'tis the Incenſe he loves. 'Tis only the Gracious Soul that hath
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59683:78"/> Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, Pardon of Sin, Communion with God, and that ſhall enjoy him for ever: This is ſuch a Chain of Pearl, that the World, were it ſold at the worth, cannot Purchaſe: Afflictions cauſe us to ſeek Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they ſend us to ſeek Faith, it ſends us to Prayer, Prayer goes to God for help; Grace it is that differences between God's Children and the Devil's Brats, and will difference between the Sheep and the Goats, and <hi>makes a man more excellent than his neighbour;</hi> and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy this Gold too dear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, Grace will not only bring us to Death, but will do us good after Death, and here nothing elſe can do it; among other things it will qualifie us to leave a Good Name behind us, which will yield a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour in the ſucceeding Generation. When the Name of the Wicked ſhall ſtink, <hi>the memory of the Juſt ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> Prov. 10.7. If we be good, and do good, we need not fear but our Name will ſurvive us. Now, <hi>A good Name is better than precious Oyntment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.1. <hi>The Righteous ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance,</hi> when the Name of the Wicked ſhall rot, his Lamp ſhall be put out in obſcurity, and ſhall leave a ſtinking Snuff behind. The Names of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, David, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and ſuch like, how ſweet do they ſmell in the Church of God? When <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas, Nero, Caligula, Domitian,</hi> and other ſuch Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Tyrants, are mentioned with deteſtation, as the Burden of the Earth, and the Plague-ſore of the World; but with what Reverence do we mention the Martyrs that ſuffered under them? The Scribes and Phariſees, which were bad
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59683:78"/> enough themſelves, yet adorned the Sepulchers of the Prophets, and Righteous Men; and however the Godly are ſlighted at preſent, in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come they will be honoured, when the Name of all their bloody Perſecutors ſhall ſtink. But this is not all that Grace will do for us after Death, for it will accompany us to Judgment alſo, which the World will not, cannot do, for it ſhall be burnt up, and if it could, would do us little good, 'tis Grace alone that can make the Judge our Friend. When Death hath left us, and we are ruſhing into the infinite Ocean of Eternity, Grace is our Pilot to ſteer our Courſe, and land us in the Haven of Bliſs; and when we appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, this is his Sheep-mark, whoever bears it ſhall ſtand upon his right hand, when all other wears the Devil's Brand, his Image and Portraiture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Sin, and there ſhall be thruſt and cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ded together with the Devil and his Angels upon the left. Grace is the Image of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Soul, which he will own where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſees it; and he that confeſſeth Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, him will he confeſs before his Father, and he that ſuffers with him, ſhall alſo raign with him. There is a difference in this Life between the Righteous and the Wicked, the one are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Seed of the Woman, the other the Seed of the Serpent; the Juſt and the Unjuſt, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Unbelievers, Righteous and Wicked, the Children of God, and the Children of the Devil, the Wheat and the Tares, the good Fiſh and the bad, the fooliſh Virgins and the wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, 'tis Grace that maketh this difference, for by Nature we are <hi>all the children of wrath,</hi> digged
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59683:79"/> out of the ſame hole of the Pit, and hewen out of the ſame Rock. God differenceth Men by theſe gracious Qualifications, and would have Miniſters difference them alſo in their Doctrine, and <hi>not give Holy things to dogs.</hi> And as they are diſtinguiſhed by God's Electing Love, and by the Operation of his Spirit, ſo have they a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Portion, both in this World, and that to come: The one feeds upon Heavenly Allowance, upon the <hi>ſincere milk of the Word, and the bread which came down from Heaven,</hi> the other finds no reliſh in it; and in the World to come the one will have a Portion in Heaven, the other in Hell; but there are many will not believe there is a Heaven or a Hell, but ere long Experience will convince them. Now, the difference that there is, is God's own work, for there was nothing in us, or that could be done by us, that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any thing at the hands of God, his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Love is the Spring and Foundation of it; <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When Faith hath knit that <hi>Gordion-knot</hi> between Chriſt and the Soul, and ſhe can ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> when the Marriage is conſummate between them, all that the Husband hath is hers, and what ſhe hath is his, then may ſhe lay claim to his Merits, his Righteouſneſs, his Graces, and his Glory; and he partakes with her in her Sins, and in her Sorrows, all her Debts are made over to him, and he helps to bear her Sorrows; and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59683:79"/> upon this the Soul, though not Legally, yet is Angelically Righteous; God changeth both the Relation and alſo the Diſpoſition. By Grace Perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> becomes a Preaching <hi>Paul,</hi> and of Lions Men are made Lambs. Now, God Adopts ſuch for his Sons, and for his Daughters, and gives them the Priviledge of Children, calls them by his own Name, ſets them about his own Work, liſts them under his own Banner, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them at his own Charges, and at laſt will lodge them in his own Boſom; when all the reſt of the World fight under the Devil's Banner, and do his Drudgery. God hath a Reward for the Righteous, though haply they have little in hand, they have the more in Reverſion; they ſhall have Eternal Life, when the other ſhall have Everlaſting Torments. Hypocrites haply may counterfeit Chriſt's Sheep-mark, as ſome have done the Broad Seal, but though they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, haply themſelves, yet can they not deceive God; <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> The Inſcription of his Seal is, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord;</hi> and they cannot put off their <hi>Briſtow</hi> Stone for a true Diamond. But as I told you, Grace will not leave a Man till it bring him to Judgment, and ſpeak for him to the Judge, who ſhall ſet him at his own right hand, when all other ſhall ſtand at his left. Oh, what a Glorious Day will that be, when ſo many Myriads of Angels and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints, each ſhining brighter than the Sun in its ſplendour, ſhall attend upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who ſhall ſurpaſs them all in Glory? But what a dreadful Day will this be to Wicked Men, when they ſhall ſee him whom they hated, to be their Judge; and they whom they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59683:80"/> and wickedly murthered, to be their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, yea, ſitting upon Thrones to Judge them alſo? Well may they call to the Mountains and Rocks to cover them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16. but in vain, for the Mountains melt at his Preſence, and the Rocks are removed out of their places; Hell it ſelf, that Dungeon of Darkneſs, cannot hide from him; <hi>For Death and Hell muſt deliver up their dead:</hi> But if they cannot ſtand before their ſelf-condemning Conſciences, much leſs before their Judge, before whoſe face their ſecret ſins are plain and manifeſt, and then will they all ſay, they muſt hear that flaming Sentence of <hi>Go, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels,</hi> &amp;c. A Sentence breathing out nothing but Fire and Brimſtone, Thundring and Lightning, Woe and Alas, Torment without end, and paſt imagination, Everlaſting Fire, Eternity of Extremity, which the Heart of Man cannot conceive, nor his Tongue utter. To depart from God, is to depart from all that good is; into Everlaſting Fire, here is the pain of Senſe; both theſe make up the Damned's Miſery, but the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration makes it compleat. Here is the never-dying Worm, that continually gnaws upon the Heart, and the Fire that never goes out, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burneth both the Soul and Body. Now Sirs, what ſay you to this? Is Grace worth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that prevents all this, and ſets the Soul out of the reach of danger? Thoſe, and thoſe alone that are adorned with Grace, ſhall be crowned with Glory; for Grace is Glory begun, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Grace perfected. Is it now worth labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for? Doubtleſs thoſe that now deride it as Fooliſhneſs, will then be derided for their Folly.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59683:80"/> Set your ſelves in the poſture you will certainly be in at Death, and at Judgment, and then think whether you will make as light of it then as now you do, and whether Cups and Queans will then give you better content. No, no, the rudeſt Ruffian then would be the holieſt Saint, and wiſh, with <hi>Balaam, to dye the death of the Righteous.</hi> But a few feigned Deſires, faint Wiſhes, and ſhort-winded Prayers, will not ſerve turn; God hath link'd Holineſs and Happineſs together, and no Man can break the Chain; many would do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Heaven, if they might pick and chooſe their Duties; and leave ſome Sins, if they might retain others; they would dance with the Devil all Day, ſo they might ſup with Chriſt at Night; they would do the Devil's Work, but have God's Wages, and leap out of <hi>Delilah's</hi> Lap into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom; they would be <hi>Dives</hi> all Day, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> at Night.

Wicked Men have no more fore-caſt for their Souls, than Fools have for their Bodies; but they will pay dear for their Folly, for when the Saints ſhall ſhine in Glory, they ſhall be caſt into a Dungeon of Darkneſs; when God lays up his Jewels, he will throw out his Muck-heaps; when he fans his Wheat, he will burn the Chaff; the one muſt go

            <p n="5">5. Conſider, Grace will not leave us thus, for its work is not done when the Judgment is over, and the Sentence paſt, for 'tis the only Treaſure we take with us to Heaven, and will not leave us, till the Crown of Glory is ſet upon our heads, nor then neither, their work is not done. Indeed ſome Graces which imply imperfection in us, as Faith and Hope, or in others, as Pity and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may ſeem uſeleſs there; for how can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and hope for what we actually enjoy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for the continuance of it? Theſe will be ſwallowed up in the fruition of what we now believe, and hope for: And for Pity and Mercy, they want their Objects, there being no Miſery in Heaven, and thoſe in Hell deſerve no Pity; here we have many wanting Brethren, whoſe Miſeries call loud for Mercy, but there they are ſupplyed; but Love, and Joy, and Delight, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and Admiration, and ſuch like, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, but much heightened in Heaven; as alſo our Knowledge there will be perfected, and the Faculties of the Soul enlarged. For as an enraged Conſcience is one conſiderable part of Hell, ſo a good Conſcience augments Heaven's Glory; when all Earthly Enjoyments, which made our Lives comfortable, forſake us, there will be a new Addition of Pleaſures and Delights given in, the duration of them will be for ever;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59683:81"/> when others leave all that is comfortable behind, theſe will leave all that implies Miſery, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; Grace will be a conſtant Companion to Eternity, the Divine Love of God, of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints and Servants of God, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abate, but be much more enlarged when our Underſtandings are enlightened to know God better, for nothing but Ignorance can ſtave off our Affections from loving him, who is the chiefeſt Good: That Marriage-knot between Chriſt and the Soul is the Foundation of our Happineſs, for from Union ſprings Communion, and the perfect Enjoyment of him in Glory, which is the Beatifical Viſion. Grace here makes the Soul follow Chriſt through Good Report, and Evil Report, through thick and thin, and makes her reſolve to have him for her Husband, though ſhe have never a merry day with him; and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to run through Fire and Water to come to him.

True Love is like unto Fire, the more you blow it, the faſter it burns; or like Lime, the more Water you pour on, the more 'tis enkindled; <hi>For many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it.</hi> Now, nothing but Grace can bear up the Head and Heart under thoſe Torments and Tortures, but a Gracious Man can ſing ſweetly when it rains ſadly, and truſt God when Deliverance is out of ſight, <hi>Hic labor hoc opus eſt.</hi> To fetch Comfort from God, when the World affords us none, is a Work of Grace, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. A ſpark of Divine Love
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59683:82"/> once kindled in the Breaſt, never goes out. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>there remains Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi> And why? Becauſe 'tis longeſt lived. The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Saints, as alſo the Folly of the World, is ſeen in this; the one reſpects Eternity, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only this Tranſitory Life; things ſubject to Vanity and Vexation, that vaniſh as a curious Picture drawn upon the Ice in a Sun-ſhine day, that ſoon diſſolves into Water. The World is like a Lottery, Men come to it with their Heads full of Hope, and return with their Hands full of Blanks, and their Hearts full of Sorrow, for there are twenty Blanks for one Prize: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair Promiſes made by the Devil and the World, but few performed; and our own hearts help to cheat us. But he that Trades in Heavenly Riches, never meets with diſappointments, they will find it far beyond their higheſt conceptions. Theſe things 'tis true, are hardly gotten, but will prove well in the wearing, and pay well for our pains. Heaven is not got ſo eaſily as the World imagines; when they moil and toil for the Earth, they think Heaven may be had with a wet finger, or into the bargain: They are like <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that dreamed that Towns and Caſtles fell into his Toyles while he ſlept; they think, a Lord have Mercy upon us, will ſerve turn for Heaven, to waſt them over, but they will find their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; the Way is narrow they muſt walk in, and the Gate ſtrait they muſt enter, which they cannot do with a load upon their backs. We muſt work for Heaven, as well as wiſh for it; yea, wraſtle <hi>and ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, 'tis the violent that take it by force;</hi> and if it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59683:82"/> be ſet to Sale, all muſt go to buy this Pearl. I have read of a Chriſtian, that beihg offered great Riches and Preferments to change his Religion, he enquired whether it were durable Riches they offered him; he would deal for no Treaſures that were not Eternal, nor ſell his Immortal Soul for tranſitory Pelf; that Treaſure that is ſubject to Ruſt and Rapine, will not do our work, but that which is as durable as the days of Heaven, and Eternity it ſelf, which we may draw out a Thouſand Years hence, without Ruſt or Canker: Theſe outward things may draw Tears from our Eyes, but never will drive Sorrow from our Hearts; if we embrace them, we hug a Cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> 'tis but to hunt Butter-flies, to foul our own Fingers. A Crown, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the top of Humane Felicity, is ſcarce worth (as one ſaith, that had tryed it) ſtooping for if it lay in the ſtreet; for if we conſider the Cares, Fears, Jealouſies, Dangers, and Troubles that accompany it, we ſhould not envy them the Honour that bear the Burden. 'Tis Wiſdom therefore above all things to get Grace, and then we ſhall have Chriſt and Glory. Men make a great duſt and ſtir in the World, and all for the Body, when there is not one day's Preparation for the Immortal Soul; many are aſhamed to be ſeen in this Faſhion, but were the Body tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and could we ſee their filthy, ſpotted, and leprous Souls through their Velvet Robes, they had cauſe indeed to be aſhamed to be ſeen in the ſtreets. Now, they matter not the Society of the Godly, but ere long they will never be troubled with it again. Now they want time to Examine themſelves, as to their future Eſtate,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59683:83"/> but then they will have time enough to reflect upon their fore-paſt Follies, the means they then had, the poſſibility, nay, the probability of their Converſion, and how they loſt Heaven for a Luſt, how they have been warned of this a thouſand times, and that now it is too late, and the Door is ſhut, the Day of Mercy is over, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dawn again. God hath long expected Fruit, and finding none, will lay down his Basket, and take up his Ax, and cut down theſe fruitleſs Trees, and throw them into the Fire, and open the Flood-gates of Divine Vengeance, and pour in upon them: All Hopes will then be taken away, and nothing but Deſpair left in the room. Now, where is the World, and what can it do for thee? But Grace will ſhelter from all this, thoſe that have this Oyl, ſhall go in, the other ſhall be ſhut out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.11, 12. What will theſe Men have to ſay for themſelves then? Will they plead what Service they have done for God? Alas, this will not ſerve their turn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. Will they deſire <hi>the Mountains to fall upon them, and the Hills co cover them?</hi> Alas, this cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17. What will the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by this time think of his Portion? Will it prove currant Coin in the other World? Is not Grace now the better Portion, that will lodge a Man in the Boſom of Chriſt, and make him drink of the <hi>Rivers of pleaſures at his right hand for evermore,</hi> amongſt thoſe Heavenly Quiriſters, the Angels and glorified Saints, ſinging Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs together, when <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped away, and ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more:</hi> Where they ſhall be freed from all Miſeries, ſet out of the reach of all Enemies, free from all Dangers,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59683:83"/> Temptations, Oppreſſions, and Troubles, in the perfect Enjoyment of all Happineſs, and lye in the Everlaſting Embraces of their dear Redeemer. Now, Reader, what doſt think of Grace? Is it worth having? If yet to prevent the Furnace, thou fall down to the Idol, thy Blood will be upon thy own Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 4. The Fourth Leſſon this Providence teacheth us, is this, That ſeeing God hath taken away one in the Prime and Flower of her Age, and thereby manifeſteth our Mortality, then it teacheth us, that the Godly have not long to ſuffer, for when Death comes, their Miſeries are at an end, for Death will ſet them out of the reach of Danger; this is the laſt Enemy they have to grapple with, and this cannot hurt us, for Death doth but lance the Ulcer (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe could never have been cured) and let out the Corruption; though it be an Enemy to Nature, 'tis a Friend to Grace; that blow that kills the Body, ſets the Soul at liberty. Of all Men in the World, none are greater Sufferers than the Godly, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though their Afflictions are ſharp, they are but ſhort; <hi>Heavineſs may continue for a night, but joy comes in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 30.5.

Here they are, with the Apoſtle, in Priſons often, but a Goal-delivery will come, when they ſhall be freed, and their Enemies be ſent to a worſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; then <hi>ſhall all tears be wip'd away from their eyes, and ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more.</hi> 'Tis here they have a Principle of Grace in them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Courſe aright, but Corruption, like a Byas to the Bowl, draws them aſide; they are like the Stars, whoſe Natural Courſe is from the Weſt to the Eaſt, but by force of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> they are hurried from Eaſt to Weſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Mens Courſe is Heaven-ward, but they are many times like the Stars, Stationary and too often Retrograde: They are like the Bird of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, with a Clog upon her heels, her Nature is to mount up, but the Clog plucks her down again; when they mount up in their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations to get a view of Chriſt, they are like a Man that looks at a Star through an Optick-Glaſs, held with a Palſie Hand, ſometimes, but 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they get a ſight of him, but they ſhall have a clearer Viſion ere long. They cannot deal with their Corruptions, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, leave them behind, when they go to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59683:84"/> no, they ſay, as <hi>Ruth</hi> did to <hi>Naomi,</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt, we will go; and where thou lodgeſt, we will lodge; and where thou art bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, we will be buried, and nothing but Death ſhall part us, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16. But 'tis but a while, and a Believer ſhall be everlaſtingly ſeparated from his ſin, and will triumph over all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Oh Death, where is thy ſting? Oh Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis true, here the beſt have no pure Beauty, they have their form freckles, yet <hi>their ſpot is the ſpot of God's people,</hi> which will waſh out, and not like the Leopard, not only in the Skin, but in the Fleſh alſo; but then <hi>they ſhall appear without ſpot or wrinkle:</hi> Here all their Comforts are mixt, and there is no fire, but there is ſome ſmoak; 'tis not ſo there: Here they lye among the Pots, but there <hi>they ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> Then ſhall they exchange Earth for Heaven, Miſery for Majeſty, and a Crown of Thorns for a Crown of Glory, but what this Glory is, we know not, but ſhall then have occaſion to ſay of it, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wiſdom, <hi>Much I have heard of it, but the one half was not told me. Paul,</hi> that had a Glimpſe of it, ſaw more than he was able to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for no word in Humane Language could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it: We can no more ſet out Heaven's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than we can take the Dimenſions of it with our Span, or empty the Sea with a Spoon. All we can do to get out of this Labyrinth is by a clue of Scripture-thread, and here 'tis but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out to us according to our Capacity, ſo much as may ſet us a longing after the enjoyment of that, <hi>which eye never ſaw, ear never heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the heart of man conceive</hi> what it is: Now,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59683:85"/> the Eye hath ſeen much, the Ear heard of more, but the Heart can conceive of more than that; as that the Earth is a Globe of beaten Gold, the Sea of liquid Pearl, every Graſs to be a Diamond, and every Sand a Ruby; the Air to be Cryſtal, and every Star to be ten thouſand times bigger and brighter than the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for what can bound our Fancy? Now, if all theſe were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, alas, it falls ſhort of Heaven's Glory, theſe things fall under our Senſes, but Heaven's Glory cannot; here is Joy without Sorrow, Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Darkneſs, and Grace is here without Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: Here is a mixture of the one with the other, and many times an Ounce of Joy hath a Pound of Sorrow; we get ſometimes a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuddenly are hurried back into the Wilderneſs, if not into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> now Health, then Sickneſs; now Eaſe, then Pain; now Poverty, then Plenty: But in Heaven it will not be ſo, our Wine there ſhall not be mixt with Water, the Storm there will be over, and the Weather always calm and ſerene. But to come nearer to our buſineſs, our Happineſs there will be partly privative, partly poſitive. I ſhall ſpeak to thoſe apart, and ſhew you firſt what we leave behind us, and then, what our Enjoyment ſhall be, and all but as in a Glaſs darkly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At Death, and not before, we ſhall be freed from all our Sin and Corruption, which is the greateſt trouble a Believer hath in this World, and indeed the cauſe of all other troubles, but at Death it ſhall never trouble them more; they may ſay of it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red Sea, <hi>Thoſe you ſee to day, you ſhall ſee no more for ever.</hi> And is not this cauſe of Rejoycing?
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59683:85"/> Sorrow follows Sin, as the Shadow follows the Subſtance, but the Cauſe being removed, the Effect will ceaſe. This it is that ſpoils all our Duties, and makes them unſavoury unto our God; for the Fountain being defiled, the Streams cannot be pure; this is the Make-bate between God and the Soul, <hi>and this hides his face from us.</hi> We can never have Peace with God, or any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Peace with our ſelves, or the Creatures, till we break our Peace with Sin; for when God is offended, our own Conſciences, and all the Creatures wait but for a Commiſſion to moleſt us, or deſtroy us. The Waters of the Flood drown'd the whole World, the Red-Sea <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, the Fire burnt up <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha</hi> and the Cities adjacent; the Earth ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up <hi>Korah</hi> and his Complices, the Walls of <hi>Aphek</hi> ſlew twenty ſeven thouſand of God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.30. The Stars fought in their Courſes againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> the very inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures take God's Part, ſo do the poor Inſects; the Flies, the Lice, the Caterpillars, what Plagues were they to <hi>Egypt?</hi> As alſo the Frogs, the Hail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And would have deſtroyed him, and all his Army, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> interceded. And Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tell us, that ſometimes a Fly, an Hair, a kernel of a Grape, a prick with a Pin, have brought Great Men to their end. Hence it was that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, he would not be in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man's condition for one hour for all the World, leſt God in that time ſhould take him hence by ſome Judgment, and ſend him to Hell. Now, though Sin have a Mortal Wound in the Regenerate, which cannot be cured, yet it will have a Being in them while they are in the Fleſh,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59683:86"/> and theſe Sons of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> are ſometimes too ſtrong for them, but at Death theſe <hi>Anakims</hi> ſhall be overcome, Death will give them their Deaths-wound; the ſame ſtroak that ſeparates the Soul from the Body, ſhall divide between Sin and the Soul: Now it ſticks as cloſe to us as the Skin to the Fleſh, or as the Fleſh to the Bones, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one Bone to another, and much cloſer; for theſe may be ſeparated, but the other not: 'tis like as the ſpots of the Leopard, not only in the Skin, but in the Fleſh alſo, nay, 'tis in the very Heart, and not only in the Body, but in the Soul alſo, yea, in the very Power and Faculty of it, yet at Death a ſeparation will be made; and this muſt needs be good News to a Believer, when his deadly Wound is cured, which is the cauſe of all his Maladies. Oh, happy day will it be to him, when he ſhall ſhake hands with his Corruptions, and give them a Bill of Divorce, and bid them an Everlaſting Adieu; when he ſhall never have a proud, vain, ſenſual, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly thought more to trouble him, or any that ſhall be unbeſeeming God, or Godlineſs. Now he cannot ſerve God without diſtraction, but then it will be otherwiſe; no ſin ſhall ſtand then as a Cloud to Eclipſe the Sun of Righteouſneſs, or cloud him from us. Now Sin makes a Godly Man a weary of his Life, and cauſeth many a ſad and ſorrowful Sigh, and many a Prayer it doth coſt him, and many a ſtruggling for the Victory; but then it will be had, and the War will be ended, and the Triumph obtained, when all Tears ſhall be wip'd away, and Sin and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be no more; and for a Crown of Thorns, they ſhall have a Crown of Glory.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59683:86"/> There is nothing now but ſin that hides God's Face from us, when theſe Clouds are removed, we ſhall ſee him as he is, and ſhall never ſee one frown in his face, nor one wrinkle in his brow, for Sin and Corruption, which are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Make-bates, ſhall be left behind, for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter into Heaven; for though the Serpent did wind himſelf into Paradice, none of the Serpentine Race ſhall ever enter into Heaven, <hi>their place ſhall no more be found there,</hi> Rev. 12.8. And if he be caſt out, his Works ſhall follow him; then the Saints will be Saints indeed, <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27. <hi>Their robes will be waſh'd in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> and they ſhall no more delight to wallow in the Mire. Heaven that ſpewed out the fallen Angels, will not admit of any unclean thing; ſin to the Godly is their greateſt Trouble here, but what would it be ſhould they be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with it to Eternity? I have read of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> that enquired, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would go after their Death? And Anſwer being made, To Heaven; proteſted they would not come there among ſo Blood-thirſty and Cruel a People. This was their Ignorance; but this I ſay, ſhould a Godly Man know his ſin ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to Heaven, it would be great cauſe of ſorrow. <hi>Anſelm</hi> affirms, he had rather go to Hell Innocent, than to Heaven with a Guilty Conſcience. 'Tis a greater Mercy to be freed from Sin, than to be born Heir to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but at Death they ſhall have the Priviledge of both; now 'tis their daily Complaint, O this hard, this proud, this hypocritical Heart! how ſhall I get it ſoftned, humbled, and reformed?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59683:87"/> But then it will be done, it will then be better than now we can deſire, or expect; here the Underſtanding is clouded with Ignorance, there the ſcales will fall from our Eyes. Many a Man would ride a Thouſand Miles, and give many Hundred of Pounds to have a clear inſight into ſome of the Myſteries held forth in the Scripture, as of the Trinity, the Incarnation, Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Redemption, Free-will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of ſome obſcure Paſſages, Propheſies, and Promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture: But there all ſhall lye open, and God's whole Contrivance in the work of our Redemption made apparent, to his Glory, and our Eternal Admiration. In a word, there ſhall no ſin, or any thing that implies a defect, enter Heaven, for no ſuch Weeds grow in God's Garden; there will be no imperfection of our love to God, our deſire after him, or our delight in him; neither any diſtempered Paſſion, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for the Affections that there ſhall remain, ſhall be ſet upon right Objects, and agreeable to the Will of God. Oh, happy time! when ſhall it be, when we ſhall be rid of all our ſins, that now keep us ſo low, and God at ſuch a diſtance from us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As at Death we ſhall be freed from all ſin, ſo likewiſe from all the Cauſes, Occaſions, and Provocations to ſin, from the Temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and Allurements of the World; for as there will be no Natural Inclination to it within, ſo there will be no Provocation to it from without; for Temptation without, now proves the Bellows to blow our Corruption up into a Flame, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Tinder to the Fire, ready to catch upon all occaſions. The Devil is a Powerful, Politick,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59683:87"/> Subtil, and Malicious Enemy, lying upon his lurches to betray us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. He is always fiſhing for Souls, and ſuits his Baits according to our Inclinations; he hath ſuch an Enmity againſt God, that he hates his Image where ever he ſees it; and though he cannot race it out, yet he will always oppoſe it, and ſeek to deface it; he is like the Scorpion, his ſting is always out, and what Oppoſition either he or his Inſtruments can make againſt it, they will be ſure to do it; but at Death we ſhall be out of his reach, and in a place of ſafety, where he cannot throw one Dart at us, nor ſhake his Chain to affright us. Now he gives us many Alarms, and if he finds us out of our Trenches, or neglecting our Watch, he is ſure to ſurprize us, and to make a Prey of us; and were we not <hi>kept by the mighty power of God to Salvation,</hi> we could not eſcape being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by him. Now we have no quiet Day nor Night, nay, in our very Addreſſes to God, but he moleſts us with his Temptations, ſometimes ſtops our Mouths, and oft-times ſteals away the Heart in the time of Duty, and lays Snares for us where ever we go, or whatever we do; but the more Spiritual the Duty is, ſo much the greater is his Oppoſition: He ſpoils our Duties purpoſely to make God hate them, he takes great Advantage indeed by our own Corruption, and we ſhall never be rid of the one, till we are free from the other: Our Senſes are the Cinque-Ports that lets in the Occaſions and Provocations to ſin into the Soul, and he ſails in with the Tide of our Corruptions; he throws in many times Peſtilent Temptations, and horrid Injections, which being reſiſted, become not our ſins, yet
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59683:88"/> are they matter of ſorrow to think that our hearts are the Soil where ſuch wicked Seed is ſown; and 'tis matter of fear alſo, leſt ſometime or other the Temptation ſhould be owned, and the Soul become Mother to the Devils Brats. Chriſt indeed, though free from Sin, was yet not free from Temptation; the Devil's Wild-fire fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wet Tinder, he had no Corruption as we have to give it Entertainment. He ſeeks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his Temptations to make us have hard thoughts of God, yea, ſometimes to queſtion whether there be a God, or whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the Word of God, or whether the Soul be Immortal, or dye not with the Body, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be hereafter a Life of retribution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And many times injects thoughts of Pride, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, Hypocriſie, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe, though not conſented to, muſt needs be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to think ſuch Tares ſhould be ſown in our Fields, though if we cry out with the Raviſh'd Virgin, it will become his ſin, though our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. He fits his Temptations, as the Fiſher doth his Baits, to our Inclinations; if a Man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Drunkenneſs, he doth not thruſt him by Head and Shoulders into the Ale-houſe, this would affright him, but ſtands behind the Buſh, and ſets a Companion to call him; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer he hath a <hi>Delilah,</hi> ſome Beautiful Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet; if ſhe be not Beautiful, he teaches her the Art to Paint, Spot, and uſe other Alluring Tricks: He hath a Wedge for <hi>Achan,</hi> and a Reward for <hi>Judas,</hi> and an <hi>All this will I give thee,</hi> for Chriſt himſelf. Now, while we are on this ſide Heaven, we are in continual danger, and great cauſe we have to dread theſe Snares, ſeeing ſo many are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59683:88"/> taken in them; if we reſiſt them, we are like to be undone alſo; they that will not howl with the Wolves, are like to be devoured by the Wolves: If we eſcape with our Eſtates, 'tis well; if with our Lives, 'tis better; if the Devil cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail by fair means, he will uſe foul. A Godly Man in this World is like an honeſt Matron that is confined in a Houſe with ſome luſtful Letcher, who is always ſolliciting her to Lewdneſs, and though ſhe deny him with diſdain, will yet give her no reſt: So, though the Devil have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Repulſes, he will not deſiſt; and if one Temptation ſail, he will try another; though we cry out, with the Raviſh'd Virgin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.25. yet ſometimes he makes a Rape upon us, and injects his filthy Seed againſt our wills; but 'tis our Natural propenſity makes us fear a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, our Hearts being ſo deceitful, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. and ſo many tall Cedars ſo fouly ſhaken in our days. But when Death comes, the Devil's Work is done, and nothing remains but that he receive his Wages; and though he and his Inſtruments trample upon us now, we ſhall then trample them under foot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.22. His Horn will be broken, and become a Trumpet for our Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. But ſuppoſe as much liberty were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in Heaven, as he hath upon Earth, to uſe as many Temptations, and ſpread as many Snares as now he doth, what would it avail? There will be no Corruption to work upon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Bait that would be taking; ſuppoſe he ſhould ſay to the Saints, <hi>All this will I give you,</hi> as he did to Chriſt, and a ſtronger Bait I know not of, any he hath. Suppoſe he ſhould offer and really give them Crowns and Kingdoms to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59683:89"/> leave Heaven's Glory, and follow him, who would leave an Eternal Kingdom of Glory, for a Tranſitory, Earthly Dominion? Now indeed we live out of ſight of this Heavenly Inheritance, and the things he offers are ſenſibly perceived, and hence it is he prevails with poor blind Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that can ſee but under their Feet, but there the ſcales will be dropt from our Eyes, and we ſhall ſee the worth of the one, and the vanity of the other, one Glimpſe whereof made <hi>Paul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things here below as dirt and dung.</hi> It muſt be a lovely Object that will draw a Believer out of the Arms of Chriſt, and make him forſake the Glory of Heaven, ſomething that muſt be better, and more lovely, but that is not in the Devil s keeping; no, no, his Work is done, and <hi>he will deceive the Nations no more.</hi> He works here upon Men's Ignorance, but there it will be expell'd; here we live in danger, but there we are out of harms-way; we need not there fear his frowns, nor regard his ſmiles; for as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tempt us, ſo he cannot hurt us; neither the World, which is his great Aſſiſtance, which here aſſiſts him in laying his Snares, and is the Bait wherewith he baits his Hook, but then it will be no Load-ſtone to a glorified Saint: Worldly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, Pleaſure, and Honour, are here things that take with Fleſh and Blood, but not in Heaven, they are not indeed here <hi>nec vero nec noſtra;</hi> but then they will be meer <hi>non entities,</hi> and no ſuch thing in being, as we call ſo here, for all Earthly things will be burnt up: Here we are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger, leſt ſome Senſe or other ſuck in the Poiſon; we can hardly open our Eyes but we let ſin into the Soul, ſomething or other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59683:89"/> Pride, Paſſion, Covetouſneſs, Uncleanneſs, or one hateful Luſt or other; the like we may ſay of our Ears, and other Senſes: No wonder then that <hi>Job made a covenant with his eyes,</hi> Job 31.1. And our Saviour bids us, <hi>Take heed how we hear.</hi> Almoſt all we converſe with are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Perſons, and have ſome Plague-ſore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon them. And may we not ſay of moſt Families, as of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> there is not a Houſe where ſome dead Perſon is not, nay, many whole Families, yea, many Pariſhes, where there is ſcarce one alive; 'tis a very <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of dead Men. Nay, our very Bodies prove Inſtrumental to betray the Soul; nay, every Creature we are converſant with proves no better, but prove Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to draw or drive away the Soul from Chriſt; and every Enjoyment proves a Snare, every Eſtate and Condition, whether we are Rich or Poor, in Honour or Diſgrace, in Health or Sickneſs, in Pleaſure or Pain, at Liberty or in Priſon, Bond or Free, every Eſtate hath its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Temptations; every Calling, from the moſt Honourable, to the Baſe; every Relation, Magiſtrate or Subject, Miniſter or People, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife, Parents or Children, Maſters or Servants, have their Temptations; Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Fair or Foul, Married or Unmarried, Young or Old, Poverty hath its Temptations, and Riches more; <hi>Agur</hi>'s wiſh, <hi>Neither Poverty nor Riches, but Food convenient,</hi> ſeems the beſt Choice. Our Cloathing oftentimes proves a Snare, if gay, to Pride or Arrogance; if poor, to Repining and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. Our Table alſo becomes a Snare, if well furniſh'd, to Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, and Exceſs; if not, to envy others that have better:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59683:90"/> So that there is not an hour free from one Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or other, for Soul or Body, or both; our very ſleep is not free, but peſtered with vain or ſinful Dreams, or fearful Viſions of the Night, our Corruption diſturbing our Fancy; nay, in our Lawful Enjoyments, <hi>Latet anguis in herbas,</hi> for no Enjoyment we have, but the Devil will weave it into a Net for our Feet, <hi>in licitis peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes,</hi> we cannot look into the World, but one thing or other is making ſuit for our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; ſo that many times I have thought an Hermitage, or ſome ſecret Cell were to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, free from the noiſe of the World, but ſuch places are not without their Temptations, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proveth; when we open our Eyes, we ſee Vanity; and when we open our Ears, we hear Folly; ſomething that tends to provoke to ſome baſe Luſt, Pride, Vain-glory, Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envy, Malice, Revenge, or ſuch-like; or otherwiſe we ſee or hear ſome Command of God broken, which ſhould provoke our ſorrow. So bitter and malicious an Enemy the Devil is, if he cannot keep us out of Heaven, he will make the way thither troubleſom; and the World is ſuch a ſworn Enemy to us alſo, not only in our Civil Enjoyments, but in our Spiritual Duties, in our Addreſſes unto God it proves a hindrance, and our own Hearts prove treacherous; theſe Fly-blow our Duties, yea, make us pride in our Graces; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ea, to be proud of our Humility, if we look not about us. Now, who would deſire to live among all theſe Snares and Temptations? but here is our comfort, Death will free us from theſe and all others whatſoever, and ſet us out of the reach of danger; for the actual Enjoyment of God, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59683:90"/> Chriſt, and Heaven, and Glory, will wholly take us up, that we ſhall have no time for, no mind to theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As at Death they are freed from Sin, and the Occaſions of Sin, from the Devil and his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo are they alſo from his Inſtruments, which Chriſt calls <hi>his Children,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the works of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will do.</hi> They have the ſame Nature and Diſpoſition he hath, <hi>viz.</hi> a hatred to God and Godlineſs, for where ever they ſee the Image of God, they pour Contempt upon it, and hence it is they Perſecute the Righteous for Righteouſneſs-ſake, whatever they pretend to the contrary. But in Heaven the Saints ſhall hear no more of this grinning Language, but ſhall be free from not only the violence of Hands, but the ſtrife of Tongues; <hi>There the wicked ſhall ceaſe from troubling, and the weary are at reſt; there the Priſoners reſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and hear not the voice of the oppreſſor; the ſmall and the great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 3.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Life is the day of Temptation, and the hour of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but at Death it will be over; the Enemy may, and oft-times doth perſecute the Godly to Death, but cannot reach them after, except they Triumph over their dead Bodies, as they did over the Witneſſes that were ſlain, but when they aroſe again, their Sport was ſpoiled; this was but over their Bodies, but their Souls they cannot reach, no Torment can touch them; and though they burn their Bodies, or rend them into a thouſand pieces, yet the leaſt Atome of them ſhall not be wanting at the Reſurrection: There are none in the World that carry themſelves more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59683:91"/> inoffenſively than they do, yet never any meet with harder meaſures from the World than they do, and the reaſon is becauſe the World hates them for Chriſt's ſake, and no wonder, <hi>it hated him before it hated them. Jeremy</hi> wonders why every one curſed him, that had <hi>neither given nor taken upon Uſury,</hi> Jer. 15.10. The Apoſtles that wronged none, but only laboured the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Good of all, met with hard dealing in the World, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from them we may know the World's Wages, and what to expect from them: Their Perſecutors were ſharp and ſevere, <hi>Verberibus pluunt colaphis grandinant,</hi> 'tis the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of bloody Perſecutors to endeavour to effect that by Arms, they cannot do by Arguments; as when the Apoſtle had confounded the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Scriptures at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> they ſought to kill him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.22. But 'tis Ignorance that breeds the Quarrel, they are Ignorant, and will be ſo, for like Bats they ſhun the Light, and are like <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that curſe the Sun when it ſhines hot upon them, <hi>Believers dare not run into the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Riot, &amp; hinc ille lachrymae,</hi> they hated Chriſt becauſe he bore Witneſs their deeds were evil; and all a Believer's Sufferings are but a Chip of Chriſt's Croſs; <hi>the ſeed of the Serpent will hate the ſeed of the Woman,</hi> for though like Dogs they worry each other, yet all joyn together againſt the Godly, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> againſt Chriſt; <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Manaſſeh, and Manaſſeh againſt Ephraim, yet both againſt Judah.</hi> Whatever the pretence be, to root out Holineſs is the intent; they are inſtigated by the Devil, and they muſt needs go when he drives them, but 'tis a comfort
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59683:91"/> he cannot go beyond his Chain, he cannot make a Louſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.18. nor drown a Pig, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.32. nor throw down a Houſe, <hi>Job</hi> 1.19. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave, and his Chain will never ſuffer him to reach them in Heaven. Here they ſuffer by Hand and Tongue, but thoſe Hands and Tongues will ſuffer hereafter, as we ſee in the Rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; here <hi>their Tongues are ſet on the fire of Hell,</hi> but then they ſhall be ſet on fire in Hell, when the Godly for their Crown of Thorns ſhall have a Crown of Glory. Here the Wicked whip their own faults upon the Saints backs, as <hi>Nero</hi> ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and laid it upon the Chriſtians, and others ſince have taken the ſame courſe; but there will be a Reſurrection of Names, as well as of Bodies; 'tis the Evening crowns the Day, and the laſt Scene the Play; when the Game is up, we ſhall know who loſeth. Chriſt tells us, we ſhall <hi>be hated of all men for his ſake.</hi> In <hi>Nero</hi>'s time whoever profeſſed himſelf a Chriſtian, muſt dye without further Tryal, as an Enemy to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and in after-ages thoſe that own Religion in ſincerity ſuffer by thoſe that profeſs what they practice. The Apoſtle bids us <hi>not to think it ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12. And Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us, 'tis no ſtrange thing; it is good to prepare for it, it will not come the ſooner, but will be better born; yea, we ſhould <hi>rejoyce to be accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. I have read of <hi>Vincentius</hi> the Martyr, that laughed at his Tormentors, and walked upon hot burning Coals as upon Roſes, and called Death and Tortures <hi>Jocularia &amp; ludicra,</hi> matters of Sport to Chriſtians; but whatever Tortures they ſuffer now, there will be none in Heaven; but the cry
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59683:92"/> of the Souls under the Altar will be heard, for Vengeance againſt thoſe that ſhed their Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. and thoſe that ſhed it will have their bellies full of Blood; their Tyranny will be over, and their Place ſhall no more be found in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. It was a miſtake of the poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> that refuſed to go to Heaven, leſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſhould torment them there. Wicked Men may here take away their Lives, but not their Graces; their Heads, but not their Crowns. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is pretended by many, practiſed by few, when ſerious Holineſs is loaded with many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Titles; when their Innocency triumphs in their Enemies Conſciences, thoſe that caſt them out ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified,</hi> Iſa. 66.5. They deal by them, as <hi>Naboth</hi> was dealt with at <hi>Jezabels</hi> Faſt, God's Glory pretended, <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for his Vineyard; but God that ſearcheth the Heart, knows the bottom of the buſineſs: But thoſe that really ſuffer for Chriſt, are truly bleſſed, and have cauſe to rejoyce, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11. for they ſerve the beſt Maſter, who will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them that either do or ſuffer for him, to go without a Reward; what is wanting in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhall be made up in Reverſion an hundred fold: They have ſomething in hand, ſome of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>'s Grapes to bear up their Heads and Hearts, but the beſt is behind. The Primitive Chriſtians were reproached, that in their Meetings they uſed promiſcuous Copulation, a Slander not yet forgotten, which did the Reporters really believe, it would be the ſtrongeſt Argument to make them turn Phanaticks, as they ſtile them, but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency triumphs in their Enemies Conſciences; they are not able to prove againſt one ſingle
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59683:92"/> Perſon, what they charge upon the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; many are the Reproachful Names they are loaded with, like the Primitive Chriſtians, that were put into Beaſt skins, and then thrown to wild Beaſts to be baited, and devoured; but God knows his own, though in a Diſguiſe; the beſt of Saints have been accounted the worſt of Sinners, but wronged Saints ſhall to Heaven, when railing <hi>Rabſhakehs</hi> come not there; the vileſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſometimes dreſt up in the Garb of Saints, but theſe Garments fit them not, but God will undreſs them ere long, and ſtrip them of their borrowed Robes, then their Paint and Plaiſter will not abide the fire, and the dirt they threw into other mens faces will appear in their own. In this Life the Godly may have unlawful Edicts made to force them to ſin, and to drive them from their Duties, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows had, and then they cry out, <hi>If thou let this man live, thou art not</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s friend;</hi> then thoſe that dare not <hi>run with them into the ſame exceſs of riot,</hi> are, with <hi>Peter,</hi> caſt into Priſon, or, with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dungeon, or, with <hi>John,</hi> baniſhed into ſome remote Country or corner of the World, or by Torments end their Lives, whoſe Blood, like the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> will cry aloud to Heaven for Vengeance, for <hi>precious in his ſight is the death of his Saints,</hi> Pſal. 116.15. What the Wit of Man, or the Policy of Hell could invent, hath been poured out upon the beſt of Men, as in the Primitive Times, and in ſucceeding Ages, to this very day, none out of Hell have ſuffered more than they; but in Heaven they have a reſting place, when their Enemies ſhall be in endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs Torments; then
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59683:93"/> ſhall the Saints be ſet out of the reach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and all their Sufferings will be made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Crown of Glory for them; for though they may (nay, 'tis odds they will) loſe ſomething for Chriſt, they ſhall never loſe any thing by him; hence the Apoſtle adviſeth us to <hi>rejoyce when we fall into divers temptations,</hi> James 1.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As their Sufferings abound, ſo will their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts alſo, for God hath Cordials againſt fainting Fits. Now the Enemies Triumph when the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſlain, but when they ſhall riſe again their Mirth will be over; they are now but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Faggots for their own burning, or like <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> making Gallowſes for their own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now their Hands are full of Blood, and their Hearts of Cruelty, but then they ſhall have Blood enough, <hi>even their own blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi> Now God's People cannot Pray in their Families, or ſing forth God's Praiſes, but one or other is offended; but then they ſhall Trumpet out his Praiſe without controul, when their Enemies ſhall wring their hands in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their hearts. The thoughts of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty made the Martyrs <hi>ſuffer joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods,</hi> yea, to kiſs the Stake, and embrace the Flames, and welcome Death as a Meſſenger of good News; then all the Floods of Perſecution will be dryed up, and the Church call'd out of the Wilderneſs, and the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhall come down from Heaven; then there ſhall be no more Tortures or Torments for them to ſuffer, no Schiſmatick wounded, and a Saint found bleeding; there will then be no more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but perpetual Peace, Love, Unity, and Concord, Eternal Enjoyment of God in Glory.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59683:93"/> Oh, what a happy Change will this be! who would not rejoyce in the fore-ſight of this, and welcome Death it ſelf, that muſt put us in the Poſſeſſion of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. At Death a Believer is not only freed from the Devil, the World, and Sin, and all his other Enemies, but alſo from all the direful Fruits and Effects of Sin, which he cannot be till Death ſets him free, and this will be to no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for though Sin in a Believer hath its Deaths-wound, yet ſo long as it hath a Being, (and that will be while he hath a Being in the Fleſh) it will have its Fruits and Effects, ſuch as theſe, Loſſes, Croſſes, Sickneſs, Sorrows, and Death it ſelf; for theſe, or ſome of theſe we ſhall be ſure to have a ſhare in while we live; but at Death, when Sin ſhall ceaſe, the Effects will ceaſe alſo; Sin and Sorrow always attend one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Shadow doth the Subſtance, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin nor Sorrow ſhall have any Being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; all Bodily Griefs, and Spiritual Maladies ſhall be removed, and Death muſt be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. Our Bodies here are ſubject to many Diſtempers, and each one will have a ſnatch at us, as ſo many Angry Curs at a Paſſenger, but ſome bite harder than others do; and by reaſon of theſe Maladies we ſpend our days <hi>inter ſuſpiria &amp; lachrymas,</hi> between ſighs and ſobs, no day nor hour paſſeth, but ſomething or other either doth, or well may diſturb our Peace, or ſpoil our Sport. No perfect Conſolation is here to be expected, in this <hi>Bochim,</hi> or place of Lamentation; for there ſhould be ſome proportion between our Sin and our Sorrow, ſome ſtorms of Sighs, if not a ſhower of Tears, for all Conſtitutions are not prone to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59683:94"/> weep; one hour's ſin may diſturb many a night's ſleep, as doubtleſs it did in <hi>David, when he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his couch with his tears, yea, made his bed to ſwim,</hi> Pſal. 6.6. His Bed that was Witneſs of his Sin, was Witneſs of his Sorrow alſo: But did our Luſtful Gallants pay as dear for their ſtoln Waters as he did, they would take more heed God hath various ways to embitter the World to his People, when they let out their Affections upon it, he whips them home when they are playing in the Dirt. Some lye long languiſhing under Bodily Diſtempers, yea, in much Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pain, as the Cholick, Stone, Strangury, Gout, and ſuch like; the beſt of Men, the choiceſt Miniſters are not always free, this makes them weary of their Lives, and, with <hi>Paul, deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> and to cry out, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> How many may we hear crying out, Oh, my Head, Oh, my Heart, my Back, my Bones, my Bowels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Bodies of ours are ſubject to a Thouſand Infirmities, Diſeaſes, Diſtempers, and Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by which Door Death will enter we know not: And ſome poor Creatures have few waking hours free from pain, for Grace it ſelf cannot prevent Bodily Diſtempers, though it enables Men better to bear them: Yet all this is but a needful Potion, preſcribed by a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a tender-hearted Phyſician. Oh Sin! how dreadful a Diſtemper art thou, that needeſt ſuch bitter Pills, and unſavoury Potions? And how bewitching a Hag is the World, that needs ſo much Gall and Wormwood to wean us from it, and needs ſo much whipping before we are willing to leave it? Theſe duſty, crazy Bodies
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59683:94"/> of ours are tender Pieces, ſoon out of Order, and like curious Inſtruments, ſoon out of Tune, or like a Clock or Watch, if one Wheel be out of Order, nothing is in; or like brittle Glaſſes, they are ſoon broken, then the Water of Life runs out at any little hole. There are multitudes of tender Veins, and tender Membranes, Fibres, Muſcles, Arteries, Bones, and Sinews in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Man, and all obnoxious to Obſtructions, Diſlocations, Extentions, Contractions, Hurts, or Dangers, all which will cauſe Pains, Aches, Griefs, and Troubles to the whole Body; and were it not that theſe were preſerved every one in its proper place, and enabled to do their appointed work, by an Omnipotent God, 'tis wonder that one day paſſeth and not many of them out of order; but however many are the weariſome Nights and Days many poor Creatures endure, and are like to do, till Death put a period to their Miſeries. Theſe Pains are but Death's Darts, and how ſoon he will hit us at the Heart we know not, and then <hi>Death it ſelf ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> And yet how loath are moſt Men to take Death's Receipts, though it be an Univerſal Cure of all Maladies? Now, if we have ſome lucid intervals, 'tis but like as in an Ague-Fit, to enable us to bear the next Fit. In theſe Earthly Tabernacles there are ſo many Doors, that ſome of them will be left open to let in Diſtempers, and Death it ſelf, but in Heaven they can never enter: Here is a mixture of Joy and Sorrow, like Chequer-work of black and white, but the moſt part black; but there will be unmixed Joy, and pure Comforts. Heaven is an Healthful place, and no Sickneſs; a Joyful place, and no Sorrow;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59683:95"/> a Happy place, where will be no Croſs; a Holy place, where will be no Sin; <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> will be writ upon the meaneſt Subject. Death at his coming will cure the Blind and the Lame; <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſhall not be lame, nor <hi>Leah</hi> blear-eyed: But Death cures not only Bodily, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diſtempers alſo, which are much more dangerous than the former; as Hardneſs of Heart, Blindneſs of Mind, Stubbornneſs of Will, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the Affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe coſt good Men many a Prayer, and many a Tear, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an aking Heart, theſe Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are too hard for them, and theſe <hi>Anakims</hi> dwell in their Land; theſe riſe up and lye down with them, and they cannot be quiet for them, they cannot go into God's Preſence, but they enter with them, and ſpoil their Duties: But in Heaven the whole Soul and Body ſhall be made conformable unto God's Will, and no Diſtemper ſhall be found in any of our Faculties. In this World alſo the ſins of others, as well as our own, are our Trouble, and help to add to our Grief; we can neither open our Eyes, or our Ears, but we ſee or hear ſomething that offends God, and therefore ſhould trouble us: We may daily ſee and hear God's Commands broken, the Goſpel ſlighted, his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers abuſed, his People perſecuted, and all manner of Wickedneſs committed. Here may we hear the Sacred Name of God blaſphemed, his Worſhip ſcorned, all manner of Ribald, Bawdy, Laſcivious, and Wanton Diſcourſe promoted, Wickedneſs defended, pleaded for, tolerated, and practiſed; and is this no Trouble to a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul? The Stews it ſelf is fuller of obſcene Diſcourſe than many Companies are, with whom
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59683:95"/> yet we have neceſſary Converſe and Commerce. This made <hi>David</hi>'s Eyes <hi>ſhed rivers of tears,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. it clouded his Countenance, furrowed his Cheeks, and grieved his Heart; and vexed <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>righteous ſoul,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. every Wicked Man was an <hi>Hazael</hi> to his Eyes, an <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> to his Heart, cauſe of weeping and lamentation, for Guilt and Grief are all we are like to get by ſuch Company, but the Lord will take notice of thoſe <hi>that are mourners in</hi> Sion, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.4. But in Heaven there is no cauſe of Sorrow, becauſe there is no Sin, the Laws of God there are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver broken. Here Relations ſometimes prove Thorns in our Eyes, and Goads in our Sides; ſome Yoak-fellows, that ſhould prove Helps, prove Hindrances, not only in Heaven's way, but as to the World alſo. Oh, what a Grief 'tis to ſee a Wife or Husband prove a Drunkard, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Perſon! Yet many a Godly Perſon hath been thus yoaked. The like I may ſay of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or other Relations: Or were it but Bodily Pains and Tortures, which our dear Relations groaned under, it muſt needs be a Corroſive to our Hearts, to ſee them under Tormenting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. Some alſo prove like <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So Holy <hi>David</hi> may have a ſcoffing <hi>Michal,</hi> and a Wiſe <hi>Abigail</hi> a churliſh <hi>Nabal.</hi> Children often-times prove Croſſes; good <hi>David</hi> may have an inceſtuous <hi>Amnon,</hi> or a rebellious <hi>Abſalom:</hi> Many good Children have bad Parents, and this is a trouble to ſee them going out of the World, before they knew why they came into it. Good Servants many times have bad Maſters, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe good Maſters bad Servants; and all this adminiſters cauſe of Sorrow: But in Heaven
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59683:96"/> theſe Tears will be dryed up, for all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants there will be perfectly Holy, and Righteous, and no Wicked Man among them. Many in this World are pinch'd with Poverty, and know not how to maintain their Families with Bread; their continued labour, and daily pains, moiling, toiling, carking, caring, riſing early, and lying down late, is all too little to provide for a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Family, and to ſatisfie an oppreſſing, cruel Landlord, ready to drink up not only their Tears, and Sweat, but their very Blood; and much ado to get with hard Labour Cloaths to their backs, or Meat to their bellies, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a little Time for their Souls good, this muſt needs be an uneaſie Life; and many times all their pains cannot keep them out of Priſons, or their Children from Beggery: Theſe Poor Men many times have when they go to Bed, a bundle of Cares to lay under their Heads, not much eaſier than a buſh of Thorns, and this is the Portion of many Godly Men. But Death will take this Burden, from them, for in Heaven there will be no racking of Rents, no grinding of the faces of the Poor; there will be Reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Labour, and Pleaſure without Pain; there is no domineering Tyrant, no oppreſſing Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, theſe are gone another Road (if Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prevent not) to pay back thoſe Tears with Intereſt they have drunk here ſo greedily. Here is no Bond-ſlave or Servant to live in ſubjection, no naked back, nor hungry bellies to feed or cloath, here is <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> God himſelf to feed upon. Here in this World Fears and Cares keep Men working by Day, and waking by Night; but 'tis not ſo in Heaven, there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59683:96"/> Pains nor Cares are neceſſary; they praiſe God for their Enjoyments, not beg for a ſupply to their Wants. Here the care of all the Churches are upon us, as upon <hi>Paul;</hi> and we ſympathize with others that are in Miſery, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did; and hence we can ſcarce open our Eyes or Ears, but we let ſome Grief into our Hearts, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution or other we hear of in one part of the World or other, ſome ſuffering Saints, ſome Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, ſome Oppreſſion or Perſecution, which adds ſtill to our Trouble; ſome Friend or other in Priſon, their Goods ſeized, or they ruined, or thoſe that have yet eſcap'd are in continual fears and expectations that it will be their condition. Wars, and Rumours of Wars fill us with Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: But there are no ſuch Diſturbances in Heaven. Here ſometimes we fear God is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Candleſtick, and taking away his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel from us, and leaving us up to <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but this fear never troubles the glorified Saints, they matter not the Pipe, that can go to the Fountain. The conſideration alſo of the Diviſions, Rents, and Schiſms, that are among Chriſtians, yea, the holieſt Men, cauſe many ſad thoughts of Heart, when <hi>Ephraim is againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, and Manaſſeh againſt Ephraim, and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judah;</hi> when one Godly Man Speaks, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and Writes ſo bitterly againſt another, and are ready to diſ-robe each other of their Graces. But in Heaven <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> the like we may ſay of other Diſſenting Parties, will agree; one Heaven will hold that that now one Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: There will be perfect Love and Unity, and no diſagreeing Perſon or Party. Here likewiſe loſs in our Eſtates, and diſappointment in our
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59683:97"/> Expectations, or in our Affairs, whether by the immediate Hand of God, want of Fore-ſight, the careleſneſs of Servants, or the malice of Enemies, may diſturb our Peace; Hardſhip and Trouble alſo in our ſeveral Callings and Employments: This makes us think that Part we Act upon the Theatre of the World is the hardeſt, and moſt uneaſie. The faithful Magiſtrate, that ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the ſins of the Times, finds ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, and the deſired Reformation not attained, he is ready to deſpond under his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The faithful Miniſter, after all his hard Labour and Study to bring Souls to Chriſt, finds not the wiſhed Effect, is ready, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. to deſpond. The like we may ſay of Parents, Maſters of Families, and other Governours, that do what they can to bring thoſe under their Charge to Chriſt, and cannot do it, are ready to faint under their Burden. But in Heaven all theſe Troubles will be over, there will be no Contention in the State, nor Trouble in the Church; no diſorder in the Family, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs in the Soul. Theſe things, and many more cauſe our Trouble here, and will do while we live, but Death will prove the Funeral of our Troubles, and the Reſurrection of our Joys. It was the rejoycing of a good Woman, that was a Martyr, that her Stake was put into the ſame hole that holy Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi>'s was before her; and it may be ſome comfort to us that we are going the ſame way to Heaven that our betters have gone in before us, and we hope ſhortly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. But that which makes our Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie is, when God hides his Face from the Soul, as ſometimes he doth; but in Heaven we ſhall
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59683:97"/> never fear loſing him, we ſhall never look into the Casket and miſs the Jewel, we ſhall never ſee a frown in his forehead, nor a wrinkle in his brow. Now we find it a hard matter to wind up our Affections to God, then it will be impoſſible to draw them off him, then we ſhall leave all theſe Clogs behind us, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did his Mantle, when he aſcended into Heaven. And this is the Leſſon this Providence teacheth us, That our Troubles here may be ſharp, they will be but ſhort, the Righteous Man hath not long to ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But the Saints Happineſs at Death conſiſts not only in freedom from Evil, but in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Good alſo. What they are freed from you have heard, what they ſhall meet with at Death reſts to be ſpoken to; but who can ſing the Songs of <hi>Sion</hi> in a ſtrange Land? Who can deſcribe <hi>that which eye never ſaw, ear never heard tell of, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive of, viz.</hi> the Joys that are prepared for thoſe that love God. Yet this I ſhould ſpeak to, but ſeeing I have treated of this in another Book, I ſhall be the briefer. Were their Happineſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their freedom from Miſery, it were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than what bruit Beaſts ſhall have, whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ends with their Life; but Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. which cannot be in this Life, for <hi>no man can ſee his face, and live: Moſes</hi> indeed <hi>by faith ſaw him that is inviſible;</hi> and ſome Glimpſe of him a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may have, but a clear Viſion is only reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Heaven; and by ſeeing God, is meant enjoying him, for without that the ſight will bring little comfort; for ought we know the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and the Damned may ſee him, as <hi>Dives</hi> did
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59683:98"/> 
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, to their greater Torment. But to ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. is to enjoy him, and this is the Beatifical Viſion, as Divines call it: Yea, we ſhall have as much knowledge of him as finite Creatures are capable of, we ſhall apprehend him, though not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, for we may as well think to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the Water in the Sea in a Cockle-ſhell; for what is finite to infinite? Yet ſhall our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him be much enlarged, <hi>for here,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we ſee but in a glaſs, but then face to face.</hi> But how God will communicate himſelf to us we know not, yet will he let us know as much of himſelf as is neceſſary to our future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we ſhall be like unto the <hi>Angels that always behold the face of God,</hi> Mat. 18.10. and for ought we know our Viſion of him may be as clear as theirs; then will he <hi>ſee no iniquity in Jacob,</hi> and they will ſee no indignation in him. How we ſhall ſee God we know not, whether he will Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallize our bodily Organs, and make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch a ſight, or whether he will only preſent himſelf to the Eye of the Mind, is not much material to us, it is ſufficient we ſhall ſee him to ſatisfaction, and by ſeeing him enjoy him; we ſhall then know him <hi>whom to know is eternal life,</hi> John 17.3. There are many Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the perfect knowledge of them is reſerved for Heaven, as the Myſtery of the Trinity in Unity, of the Incarnation, of the Hypoſtatical Union, of God's Electing Love, the Myſtery alſo of our Redemption, and many more, which call rather for Faith to believe, than Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove; but then they will be fully unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we ſhall ſee infinite Wiſdom in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59683:98"/> and a ſweet Harmony among them, and that which was to the <hi>Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> will then be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to be perfect Wiſdom. Indeed Knowledge in it ſelf now is excellent, more bright than the Morning, or the Evening-ſtar, but what will it be when perfected, when 'tis freed from all the dregs of Error, and refined from all the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oſs, Chaff, and Bran that now accompanies it? which cannot be in this World. Here we are hindred from the Enjoyment of God by our Corruptions, for <hi>he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity</hi> with approbation; but when thoſe ſpots are waſht away, and thoſe Blackamore skins changed, we ſhall walk in white, and <hi>follow the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here we have a taſte of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Grapes, but there is the full Vintage. When we paſs this <hi>Jordan</hi> by the narrow Bridge of Death, we ſhall enjoy the promiſed Land; for though we have little in Poſſeſſion, we have much in Reverſion: We ſhall need no Ship when we are ſafely landed in the deſired Haven; we ſhall need no Armour when the War is over, nor need we run when the Prize is won, no Creature-comforts, when we have in God a full Supply; we need not pray for our ſelves, when we live in the actual poſſeſſion of all good things; nor for others, for the Wicked are paſt hopes, and the Godly paſt fears; and we ſhall ſee ſo much reaſon for the Damnation of the Wicked, though they be our Relations, that we ſhall rejoyce in it, and glorifie God for it, and admire that Hell
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59683:99"/> being ours by Birth-right, we ſhould have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inheritance; but then we ſhall know more of God's Electing Love than now we do, which now is a great depth, which no Man can Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; nothing ſhall then remain that implies Imperfection, then ſhall our Sorrow be turned in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Joy, and our Sighing into Singing; but when the Joy it ſelf is unconceivable, what concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, much leſs adequate expreſſions can we have of it? We ſhall have the full Enjoyment of God, but what that is, no word in Humane Language can expreſs: The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> who ſaw the Transfiguration, tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when Chriſt ſhall appear, we ſhall be like to him, and ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was caught up into the third Heaven, <hi>heard unutterable words, and ſuch as are not lawful for a man to ſpeak,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.4. And we may as well comprehend all the Water in the Sea in a Cockle-ſhell, or meaſure out Heaven with our Span, as fully to deſcribe Heaven's Happineſs, or Hell's Miſery. We are ignorant of many things here below, yea, many things in our ſelves, of our Immortal Souls, how little do we know, and many Secrets in Nature are hid from the moſt refined Wits; what then is it like we ſhould know of Angels, of God, of Heaven, and Glory? Such ſtrange conceits 'tis like we have of them, as a blind Man that never ſaw, hath of Colours, or of the Sun it ſelf: What Deſcription can we make of it that ſhall reach their Underſtanding? Or what Conception do we imagine a bruit Beaſt can have of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, which yet are at a far leſſer diſtance, than between us and the Creator, and therefore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59683:99"/> our apprehenſions of him muſt be far lower than the bruit Beaſts are of us; yet this we know of him, that all Good is eminently in him, and what is good in the Creatures flows from him; and is a Drop out of this Ocean, a Ray of this Sun, a Spark of this Fire? And if we enjoy God, we ſhall enjoy all that is really Good. That we ſhould be with him, was the Prayer of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. and doubtleſs the greateſt Bleſſing: But we may ſay of the Glory of Heaven, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.2. the one half was never told us; 'tis true, we read that the Walls are of Jaſper, the City of pure Gold, the Foundations of Precious Stones, the Gates of Pearls, the Street of Gold, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 21.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the moſt precious things the World brags of, but there are no ſuch Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things in this <hi>building not made with hands,</hi> theſe Materials are too courſe and beggarly to build the City of the Great God; 'tis built of Glory, but what that is we know not, or what that Bread of Life, and Water of Life, hidden Manna, promiſed to thoſe that overcome, will be beſt known in the Enjoyment; <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart,</hi> but the Harveſt will be in Heaven: Here we may have a dark Night, and haply darkeſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Day, but there will be a Glorious Morning; now we are under Clouds, and ſuffer many Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ms and Showers, but ere long we ſhall be taken up above the middle Region, where no Clouds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there God will own us for his Children, and Chriſt for his Spouſe. Oh, what a change will then be! here we can ſcarce have a Glimpſe of Chriſt, there the full Enjoyment; here we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59683:100"/> know little, but there we ſhall know all things, and be ignorant of nothing that is neceſſary to be known; and as Knowledge doth increaſe, ſo will our Love both to God and our Brethren: The more Excellency we ſee in God, or them, the more our Affections will be let out upon them, for nothing but Ignorance can ſtave off our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the chiefeſt Good. When theſe ſcales are fallen from our Eyes, we ſhall love God above our ſelves, becauſe he is better, and love his People better than now we do, becauſe they will be better than now they are, refined from their Droſs; Love will run in the right Channel, and be ſet upon right Objects, God ſhall have all our Love, we ſhall love his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by a reflect act; we ſhall love God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Creatures for his ſake, and where we ſee moſt of God, there we ſhall love moſt; now we complain we cannot love him, but then we cannot chooſe but love him, for who can be in a fire and not burn? Our Love to him here, though true in its kind, yet is full of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and like an Ague, hath its heats and colds, but there is no intermiſſions, it admits of no cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Ignorance here makes the <hi>Pearl of great price</hi> undervalued, and moſt Swine rather delight in Swill, and with <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Cock, prefer a grain of Barley before it, but theſe will be better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its worth. The Godly here have but a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> ſomething to animate them in the way, and to ſtay their ſtomack, but the Feaſt is for their Journey's end, where they ſhall drink Wine with Chriſt in his Father's Kingdom. 'Tis a Queſtion with ſome, whether there are degrees of Glory in Heaven; a full Anſwer will be beſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59683:100"/> made by the Inhabitants themſelves. Something may be ſpoken to it, as to probability at leaſt, there will be no difference as to the duration, for Eternity admits not of addition or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as for degrees, in general every one ſhall enjoy as much Happineſs as they are capable of, as much as their Veſſels will hold, and there ſhall be no cauſe of complaint or repining at others, nay, or of deſiring more for themſelves, for this argues Imperfection of Happineſs, which Heaven owns not. Yet it ſeems probable there will be degrees, <hi>The righteous then will ſhine as the firmament, but thoſe that turn many to God, as the ſtars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3. Now, the Stars ſhine brighter than the Firmament, and <hi>ſome ſtars differ from others in glory.</hi> There are degrees of Torment, <hi>For he that knew his Lord's will, and did it not, was to have the more ſtripes,</hi> Luke 12.47. And Chriſt tells us, <hi>It ſhould be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>in the day of Judgment, than for thoſe Cities</hi> he preached to, and they not repented, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. And I wiſh <hi>England</hi> be not ſick of this Diſeaſe, in making light of Chriſt; the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet were caſt alive into the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this ſeems to be a higher degree of Torment than others have. And again, the Scripture ſpeaks of a greater degree of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that every one ſhall receive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to his Works; and ſome being greater ſinners than others are, Juſtice requires they ſhould ſuffer more; and the unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. hath his Portion appointed with Hypocrites, which ſeems ſome peculiar

               </gap>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59683:102"/> Puniſhment. Now, there being degrees of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell, and he that deſerves moſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall have moſt, why not of Glory in Heaven, where he that hath done moſt Work, ſhall have moſt Wages: And although I dare not ſay there are Nine <hi>Hierarchies of Angels</hi> in Heaven, as the Papiſts do, yet we read of Angels, and Arch-Angels, as well as of the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and why not then degrees of glorified Saints? He that by his Pound gained ten Pounds, was made Ruler over ten Cities, when he that had gained five Pounds, was Ruler only over five Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and what this ſignifies but a higher degree of Glory I know not, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16. And Chriſt promiſes his Apoſtles, <hi>that followed him in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, they ſhould ſit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not promiſcuouſly promiſed to all: And thoſe that have forſaken any thing for Chriſt, have greater Promiſes than others have. Thoſe therefore that deſire a greater degree of Glory than others, let them improve their Talents bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than others do. Another Queſtion may be, Whether the Saints in Glory ſhall know each other? In Anſwer to it, I ſay, if it make for their future Glory, doubtleſs they will, for they ſhall want nothing of Perfection, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture looks very favourably upon the Affirmative. Chriſt tells us, That <hi>many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven; but the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be thruſt out:</hi> And ſhall they ſit with them and not know them? In the Transfiguration the Apoſtle knew <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Rich Glutton in Hell knew
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59683:102"/> 
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Boſom. And is it probable that Men living here on Earth ſome few Years, when the Underſtanding is clouded with Ignorance, and the Memory with Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, know one another, that they ſhould not know one another through Eternity, when thoſe Miſts are blown over? Some alſo queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Souls of Believers go immediately into Heaven at the Death of the Body; and this ſeems to me as plain as the other, 'tis Chriſt's Promiſe to the Penitent Thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> And this I judge was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Hell nor Purgatory, for I know not where thoſe are called Paradice. <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was carryed into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, where he was comforted, while the Rich Man was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. But I ſuppoſe there is little comfort in Purgatory-flames, this Fire is but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled, and were it not to warm the Pope's Kitchen, would be ſoon extinguiſhed. In a word, the Scripture mentions Heaven and Hell, as the Receptacles of ſeparated Souls, but there is no mention of another place. Some alſo enquire, if they go immediately into Glory, whether they have at preſent the full degrees of Glory which they ſhall have hereafter. I Anſwer, <hi>Secret things belong to God, but things revealed, to us.</hi> It ſeems probable that though they have as much Glory as thay Entitle them truly Happy, yet there will be a further degree added at the Reſurrection, when Soul and Body ſhall be reunited, and the Sentence of Abſolution paſt upon them, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> Then, as <hi>the wicked go into everlaſting torments, ſo the righteous ſhall go into life eternal,</hi> Mat. 25.41.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59683:103"/> And thus you have heard of the Happineſs of Believers, but the duration of their Happineſs is the chiefeſt Flower in their Garland; for were it but to continue a thouſand thouſand Years, it would be a Hell to them in the midſt of Heaven to think that an end would come, and it would make them they could little rejoyce in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: But the conſideration that it will be for ever, is a great addition to their Happineſs; 'tis to be <hi>for ever, and for ever,</hi> Dan. 12.2. And 'tis called <hi>eternal Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. And Reaſon ſhews it muſt be ſo, for the Soul is immortal, and the Reward promiſed is ſuch; and this Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Eternal Life. So then you ſee proved what before was aſſerted, That ſeeing all muſt dye, the Righteous have not long to ſuffer, for Death will ſet an end to all their Miſeries, and enter them into their Eternal Enjoyments of God and Glory, and put them into the poſſeſſion of thoſe <hi>Manſions of Glory, prepared for them by God before the foundations of the world.</hi> And then any Man may judge whether there be any great cauſe why they ſhould fear Death, which is the only Cure of all their Miſeries, and the only Porter to open Heaven-gates to them. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we ſpeak ſomething of thoſe whoſe Happineſs expires with their Life, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries commence at their Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 5. The Fifth Leſſon this Providence teacheth, is, That ſeeing Men and Women may be taken away in the Flower of their Age, and Death can put a period to their Lives, then what a miſerable condition are Wicked Men in, when one day may put an end to all their Happineſs,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59683:103"/> and all their Hopes, for both their Happineſs and their Hopes is only in this Life, and ſhall expire at their Death; for whether they are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Baſe, Rich or Poor, Young or Old, by what Names or Titles ſoever they are dignified or diſtinguiſhed, if they have no better a Portion than the World can beſtow upon them, 'tis at the longeſt for term of Life, and at Death their leaſe expires; <hi>Their Glory then will not follow them, and their Pomp will take her leave.</hi> Oh, what a change Death will make among many of our greateſt Gallants! their Happineſs depends upon a tickliſh point, and hangs but by the thread of their Lives; and there are a thouſand Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, Diſtempers, Caſualties, and Accidents ready to cut the thread, and every Creature waits but for a Divine Commiſſion to ſtop their breath, and they are not ſure of one day to an end. The Experience of this very Age proves this point fully, how many hundred thouſands were in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtript of all in a moment, and left as poor as <hi>Job,</hi> and many loſt their Lives with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. The like may we hear of in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in <hi>London</hi> an hundred thouſand dyed in one Year; and what a change did Death make to them, that have their Portion only in this Life? What the Wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Rich's take wings, and fly away.</hi> We ſee by Experience many rich at Night, and poor ere Morning, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59683:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience, and theſe make a hard bargain, for the Soul is more worth than all the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. That a Wicked Man is not long to enjoy his Happineſs, is made out in the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, at Death all Men, of what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoever, from the leaſt to the greateſt, will leave behind them all theſe outward Enjoyments, <hi>viz.</hi> Riches, that very many ſo much glory in, and truſt to, and cannot take with them the worth of a ſhoe-latchet. Woe then to them that have no other Portion, what will their poor Souls do to Eternity, though now their Riches be their ſtrong hold, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. yet can <hi>they not help in the evil day,</hi> Zeph. 1.18. Yet here they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as Gods, but they are but Dung-hill Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, moſt Men dote upon them as much as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did upon <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple, and Offer not only their Children, but their Souls unto them: But let their Attainments or Enjoyments be what they will, at Death they muſt leave all behind them; Kings and Emperours muſt leave their Crowns behind them, and the Biſhop his Mitre, the Pope himſelf not excepted; then thoſe that have made a great hurly-burly in the World, could not ſatisfie, their Duſt will be contained in a little Urn. At Death the Emperour muſt lay by his Robes, and the Beggar his Rags, for Death will lodge them in the ſame Bed, and ſet them upon even ground. The griping Uſurer muſt leave his Gold, and ceaſe to fill his Bags with Silver, when his own Mouth ſhall be fill'd with Earth. Kings then muſt bid farewel to their Crowns and Kingdoms, as <hi>Solomon</hi> to his Ivory Throne; and our great Gallants their well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59683:104"/> Houſes, though <hi>they call them after their own names,</hi> Pſal. 49.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Haply they may leave them to Fools, haply to Strangers, haply to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to enjoy. It was the Speech of a good Man to a great Lord, when he ſhewed him his ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Buildings, pleaſant Gardens, Walks, Orchards, and other Rarities, <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you muſt make ſure of Heaven, or you will never be recompenced in the Earth for all the Pains and Coſt you have beſtowed here.</hi> Yet many, like the Rich Man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. ſing a <hi>Requiem</hi> to their Souls, and promiſe themſelves long Life, when haply they have not a day to live, <hi>They put the evil day far from them,</hi> and becauſe they ſee not Death, think Death heeds not them, when he is even ſtaring them in the Face. They lodge Riches neareſt their Heart, and from it they expect their greateſt Security, but the Mortal Sithe is too hard for the Royal Scepter, yet many conſider it not, but buy Faggots for their own burning, for <hi>the ruſt of their Gold will eat their fleſh as fire,</hi> James 5.3. Here they have their Summer and their Winter Houſes, curious Parlours, Banqueting-Houſes, Rooms richly adorned, ſoft Beds, and eaſie Couches; but if they have no better Portion, Death will ſtrip them of this, and lodge them in a ſtinking Dungeon, and darkſom Cell, full of deadly Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, void of Light or Comfort, a noiſom, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous, ſtinking Priſon; here are no curious Gardens, or pleaſant Walks for Recreation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing to recreate the Eyes, the Ears, the Smell, the Taſt, or the Touch; the Object of Sight will be Infernal Devils, and Damned deſpairing Wretches; the Melody the groans and ſighs, the roaring, yelling, ſcrietching
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59683:105"/> of damned Souls; for the Taſte, pinching Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and parching Thirſt, or ſomething that is worſe; their Smell is burning Brimſtone, and their Touch the ſcorching Flames. Oh, the Pains, the Time, the Coſt and Charges many Men are at in adorning their Habitations, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Walks, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when all this while the poor Soul lyes neglected, and ſlighted; no Tree in the Orchard muſt grow diſordered, but muſt be pruned, muck'd, and manured, when in the Soul nothing is in order; no Weed muſt grow in the Garden, when no Vice muſt be weeded out of the Soul. Here they have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Walks, and Summer-ſhady Bowers, their Rich Paſtures, Pleaſant Meadows, their Flocks and Herds, their numerous Cattle, both ſmall and great, and whatever their hearts can deſire, that can be purchaſed for Love or Money; but Death will ſtrip them to the skin, and they ſhall carry nothing hence, neither can they call ought their own, but Tortures and Torments, Sighs and Groans, Anguiſh and Sorrows, Tears and Plaints. Here they ſolace themſelves, and like the Rich Glutton, go bravely clad, <hi>and fare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly every day;</hi> but there they cannot command a Cup of cold Water, nay, nor get it with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, to cool their Tongue. Now they indulge their Fleſh, and pleaſe their Fancy, and like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 2.4. deny nothing to themſelves, that can be attained, but ere long they will be forc'd, as he was, to ſay, <hi>All is vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit,</hi> ver. 17. All theſe things muſt be left behind, and were this the worſt it were well, but their eaten Bread will not be forgotten; well had it been for many of them had they begged
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59683:105"/> their Bread from Door to Door, or earned it in the ſweat of their brows, for then ſo many abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Talents had not been charged upon them, and ſo many abuſed Mercies to be anſwered for. Here they have their Tables richly furniſhed, with what the Earth, the Sea, the Air can afford, and many new-invented Diſhes to allure the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and provoke the Appetite, when their poor Brethren have not Bread to eat: They have their great Attendants, Muſick of all ſorts, their wanton Songs, their Plays, and Interludes; but Sighs and Groans will then be their chiefeſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and fineſt Melody, their Mirth will then be changed into Mourning, and their Joy into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs. Oh Death, what a change wilt thou make among our Luſtful Gallants! Here they burn in Luſt one to another, but there, though they lye together in the ſame Bed of Horror, their Luſting will be over. Thoſe that now think the Ground not good enough to tread upon, and will not ſuffer the Sun to ſhine upon them, nor the Wind to blow upon them, for ſpoiling their Beauty, ſhall then be heated more rudely in the Flames. Thoſe that think no Meat or Drink good enough, nor any Attire fine enough, will then be put into a courſer Dreſs, Hell Fire will ſpoil their Paint and Plaiſter, and Beauty-ſpots, their curled Locks, and powder'd criſped Hair, then one drop of Water will be better than all theſe; here are no Masks nor Fans to ſhelter them from the ſcorching Flames, their Bags of Gold and Precious Jewels muſt then be left behind.

We ſee Riches are uncertain here, and will certainly fail when we have moſt need of them. Did griping Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, that drink the Sweat, the Tears, if not the Blood of their Oppreſſed Tenants, and make Muſick of their Groans, think of theſe Times, and of theſe Things, thoſe Morſels they now ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſo greedily, will have a poiſonful Operation. Many there are, that inſtead of feeding the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and cloathing the Naked, pluck the Meat from their mouths, and the Cloaths from their backs, to maintain their own Pride and Luxury; they put the Poor's Part into a Child's Portion, haply into a Whore's Lap; but the Lord of ſuch Servants will come at an hour they are not aware of, and give them their Portion with Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 <hi>laſt.</hi> Now they have their Stage-Plays, Morrice-Dances, Wakes, May-games, and ſuch Revels, to drive Time away, which alas, flies too faſt of it ſelf; but what Recreation have they invented to make Eternity ſeem ſhort? Death will daſh all theſe Vanities out of Countenance. Here ſometimes a little of Hell-fire flaſh'd into the Conſcience, ſpoils the Sport; but there will be not only flaſhes, but flames. Here they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to drink away theſe Heart-qualms, and allay theſe Dumps, but in Hell they cannot do it. The griping Uſurer here hath a dry Dropſie the more Riches he drinks in, the more he thirſts; but there the Thirſt will be allayed with Fire and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59683:106"/> Brimſtone. Here our Female Gallants ſpend their Time in their Glaſſes, they muſt not have a Pin awry, or an Hair amiſs, their naked Breaſts, and painted ſpotted Faces; Oh, what a change will Death make in their Garb and Ornaments! And indeed could we but ſee the Deformity of the Soul through the gariſh Habit of the Body, how leprous and deformed would many appear? They would be aſhamed to walk the ſtreets. Here they are ſet out like Puppets for to ſhew, to allure unwary Youth; for if there be no Wine in the Cellar, why hangs the Buſh? But theſe gaudy Robes are too thin to keep off a ſhower of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance. We may ſee how God approves of ſuch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Ten Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> is thought too little, but ere long a poor Urn will hold their Aſhes, and a dark Dungeon their Souls; then they muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay of all theſe things, as the Prophet of his Ax, <hi>Alas, Maſter, for it was borrowed.</hi> God hath entruſted them with other mens Portions as well as their own, but they have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſole Proprietors, and abuſed the Talents given to another end, but they muſt pay back every Farthing. 'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> that 'tis two Miles in compaſs, and his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are wide and large, and his Incomes great; but Death can Scale theſe Walls, as well as thoſe of a poor Cottage. Could Great Men renew the Leaſe of their Lives, as Men do of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, doubtleſs there would be great Fines given, but it will not be; they make a great buſtle in the World, and ſeek to turn all topſy-turvy for a while, and all to ſet themſelves on high, till Death the Leveller comes, and equals them with their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59683:107"/> poor Neighbours; for what is the difference now between <hi>Alexander</hi> and his meaneſt Slave? And ſometimes a Fool, ſometimes a Stranger, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Enemy enjoyeth the Eſtate that they leave behind, and they take nothing with them but Guilt upon the Conſcience, and Sin upon the Soul, and the <hi>Ruſt of their Riches will eat their fleſh like fire,</hi> James 5.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But miſtake not, 'tis not all Rich Men that I ſpeak of, but thoſe that abuſe their Riches, by loving them, truſting in them, employing them to maintain Pride, Luxury, or ſome other filthy Luſt, or <hi>with-hold good from the owners thereof;</hi> thoſe that miſpend the Talents lent them for a better uſe, for if the Servant that only hid his Talent, was caſt into outer Darkneſs, what will become of them that wilfully waſte it? Pride is a Worm that often breeds in Riches, and the never-dying Worm breeds in Pride: Riches in themſelves are great Bleſſings, and, if not abuſed, will prove helps in Heavens-way: <hi>Make friends</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> But to many they are the greateſt blocks in Heavens-way, and this makes it ſo difficult a thing for Rich Men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.24. Heaven is a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Palace, but 'tis a narrow Way, and ſtrait Gate that leads to it, and Men cannot enter with the World upon their backs, there muſt be ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtripping, to get in: Hence the Apoſtle <hi>charges rich men not to be high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. 'Tis much ado to look, and not to luſt; to have Riches, and not fall in love with them. When Pride breeds in Riches, as Worms do in Apples, they ſuddenly corrupt, and will do the Owners no good; to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59683:107"/> 
               <hi>uſe the world, and not abuſe it,</hi> is a Leſſon not eaſily learned, and <hi>having only food and raiment, therewith to be content.</hi> In Chriſt's time <hi>the poor received the Goſpel,</hi> when few of the Great Ones were called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. Were there but half ſo much ſpoken againſt Poverty, and half ſo many cautions given as againſt Riches, there would be ſome Plea for the Covetous, but few ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a great Eſtate; but Death will equal the Poor with the Rich, the Emperour muſt leave his Robes behind, and the Beggar his Rags; and great <hi>Saladine</hi> ſhall carry nothing with him but his Shirt, nor that neither into the other World, <hi>Haud ullas portabis opes Acherontis ad undas, Naked we came into the world, and naked ſhall we return out of it,</hi> Job 1.21. 1 Tim. 6.7. The <hi>Jews</hi> were permitted when they came into their Neighbour's Field, Orchard, or Vineyard, to pluck and eat, but muſt carry none away; and ſo we may do in the World. Riches at laſt will do us no more good, than they did the great <hi>Chaliph,</hi> that the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> cauſed to be famiſhed amidſt his Treaſures; then will their Sun ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cloud, and no difference between them and their poor Neighbour; thoſe that have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the greateſt Burden, have the ſoreſt Back; and thoſe that have received the moſt Talents, are to make the greateſt Account. Oh that this were well conſidered in time, then ſhould we <hi>lay up our treaſure where neither moth nor ruſt corrupteth, nor where thieves break not through, nor ſteal,</hi> Mat. 6.20. For all other Treaſure will deceive them, that put their truſt in it. Thus you ſee at Death Wicked Men, whatever their Enjoyments now be, will be ſtript of all.</p>

Many ſpend their Time in Recreation, and follow no other Calling, and ſome cannot give a good Account of one hour's Work in a whole Week, ſpent in any Lawful Labour; they think 'tis a greater ſhame to be ſeen working, than to be ſeen drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or debauch'd; ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle calls <hi>lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.4. and well he may, for they ſpend more Time in, and are at more Coſt about their Pleaſures than in God's Service, and thirſt as greedily after them, as ever Covetous Man did for Gold, or Ambitious Man for Honour.

               </gap>e many in our common Dialect are called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Pleaſure,</hi> and the Name pleaſeth them, that both God and former Ages call'd common Whores, and 'tis like they will be owned for ſuch at the day of Judgment, and then woe be to them, for they are of the Society that are appointed for Deſtruction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, <hi>&amp;c. Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17. <hi>He that loveth pleaſure, ſhall be a poor man;</hi> and we ſee many times Luxury and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery ſucceed each other, and unlawful Luſts have ruined many Ancient Families, and made them leave <hi>Marcus Livius</hi> his Portions to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Nihil praeter Coelum &amp; Caenum,</hi> Air and Water. But if it go ill with the Body, it will go much worſe with the Soul; for thoſe that can
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59683:108"/> take no Pleaſure in God, God will take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them; theſe Men ſeem to think they were ſent into the World, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> into the Sea, <hi>to ſport therein,</hi> and that their Talents were given to no other end than to be conſumed this way; and then when God ſaid to Man after the Fall, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy bread,</hi> that he ſpake only to the Poor, and not to them; but they will at Death find their miſtake, and ſee it was a bad Bargain to ſell their part in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi> for a part in <hi>Paris;</hi> to ſell their Souls to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their Luſts, to part with Eternal Joy, for momentany Delights; they will find they parted with a great deal in Reverſion for a little in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, they will then have time enough (if Eternity may be called Time) to repent the Bargain; they will ſee it had been better to have been preſerved in Brine, than to have rotted in Honey. Now they can take <hi>the Timbrel and the Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ, and ſpend their days in mirth,</hi> (as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith) <hi>and ſuddenly go down to the pit,</hi> Job 21.12, 13. I will not ſay as <hi>Tully, Nemo Sobrius ſaltat;</hi> nor as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> The better Dancer, the worſe Man, or that theſe Recreations are abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet I think Chriſtians have not much time to ſpend this way, from their more ſerious Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and greater Concerns; and truly if we conſider the ſtate of the Proteſtant Churches throughout the World, it might take off much of the edge of our Affections from theſe Vanities. But at preſent I am ſpeaking of thoſe to whom the ſatisfying of their Luſts is the main deſign they aim at, and the Affliction of the Church is not ſo much as the looſing one ſpot off their Faces, one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59683:109"/> Feather out of their Fan, or one Ribon out of their Head-tire; let ſuch read well <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſee if God delight as much in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments as they do; and what he ſaith to ſuch, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3, &amp;c. They <hi>put far from them the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to draw near. They lye upon their beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their Couches; they eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the ſtall. They chant to the ſound of the Viol, and invent to themſelves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick like</hi> David: <hi>They drink wine in bowls, and anoint themſelves with chief Oyntment, but are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not this an exact Deſcription of many in our times? Read further the Deſtruction that God threatens to ſuch, and they will find he ſpake in earneſt, what they took in jeaſt.

               </gap>zing, in Drunkenneſs, and Debauchery? How many of our Female Gallants are there, that think the Morning ſhort enough to ſleep, and riſe, and dreſs themſelves before Dinner, and perhaps have more than one to aſſiſt them in the work, when their Devotion is ſhut up in a little room, if at all thought upon, and haply more Curſes than Prayers are put up, eſpecially if their Taylor, Sempſter, Waiting-Maid, Painter, have not pleaſed them. And the Afternoon the time is little enough for Diverſion; ſome idle Viſit, ſome wanton or obſcene Diſcourſe, ſome Stage-Play, Shew, or Interlude, Cards, or Dice, or ſome ſuch Recreations, or ſome Exerciſe haply worſe; and thus they paſs one Day, Week, Year after another, till Death ſnatches them hence, and they never have any time to be ſerious, or think upon their Eternal Condition: But Chriſt never directed us in ſuch a pleaſant way to Heaven, nor the Apoſtles never found it, neither can it be the narrow way the Scripture ſpeaks of; <hi>Theſe put the evil day far from them,</hi> and the thoughts of Death will put them out of Humour, but Death will make them more ſerious. Now theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Courſes put them on to rack their Rents, and Oppreſs their Tenants, and poor Neighbours, and keep back the Poor's Portion, and all little enough to maintain their Pride and Prodigality; thus they ſpend their time in Drinking, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ranting, and Blaſpheming, in Ramming, Damning, and in Perſecuting thoſe that make any ſhew of Religion, or Civility; in <hi>rioting, drunkenneſs, chambering, and wantonneſs,</hi> Rom. 13.13.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59683:110"/> Theſe are they that <hi>make their bellies their God,</hi> Phil. 3.19. And many of both Sexes there are that Sacrifice to theſe Dunghill-Deities, ſo that a Scavenger, whoſe Office is to empty Jakes, is to be preferred before theſe, that only live to fill them. They are like unto the <hi>Panphagi,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> whoſe very Life was to eat, and to devour, from whence they had their Name, whom theſe Men ſeem to ſucceed; and they may fitly be compared unto the <hi>Jerfe,</hi> a Beaſt in the North of <hi>Suetia,</hi> which, having got his Prey, eats as long as his Skin will hold, and then ſtrains himſelf backward between two Trees that grow near together, till he hath evacuated his Meat, and then eats as before; a fit Emblem of a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard and Glutton, that when they have gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized, uſe means for Evacuation, and at it again. Of this Herd were <hi>Epicurus, Heliogabalus, Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi> and many more Monſters in Nature. They are like Swine, for ſcarce any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will eat or drink more than ſufficeth Nature; they are (ſaith the Prophet) like fed Horſes, every one Neighing after his Neighbour's Wife. I have read of one, that to ſatisfie all his Senſes and ſenſual Appetites, in three Years time ſpent Thirty Thouſand Pounds, and ſware that had he ten times as much, he would ſpend it all to live like a God, in Pleaſure, for one Week, though he knew he ſhould be damned for it the next day after. But little did he know what Damnation ſignifieth, but in Hell he will change his Mind. And ſuch deſires I fear are too frequent in the World, and were not Men bounded by their Eſtate, I fear their Deſires would be as unbounded as his; and were it but for the loſs of the Soul,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59683:110"/> they would not ſtick at it.

The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Man hath commonly too high thoughts of himſelf, and too low of others, and thinks the World takes not ſufficient notice of his Worth. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> thanks God <hi>he was</hi> not ſuch a one as the Publican, when he was much worſe; theſe Men look upon themſelves in a Magnifying-Glaſs, and wonder at their own bigneſs, but when they look upon others they turn the Glaſs, and look upon them to be far leſs than they are; but the beſt way is to look in God's Glaſs, which will not deceive us. Many think what others have, whether of Riches or Honour, is too much; but what they have, is always too little; they are like the Rich Man in <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable, ready to ſpare their numerous Flocks, and make uſe of the Poor Man's only Lamb; but ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greedy griping gets little. <hi>Xerxes,</hi> though he had 127 Provinces, not being content, ſeeking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Territories, was ſlain, and loſt what he had (like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Dog, that loſt his Meat by

Great <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> had ſcarce ſo much allotted him; and our <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> was three days unburied, before the Controverſie was ended whoſe the Land was where he ſhould be laid. In this Life theſe things are uncertain, but at Death they will be certainly taken from us, and how ſhort our Life is, we little know; a little Spider, an Hair in Milk, the Kernel of a Grape, the prick of a Pin, have put a period to the Life of ſome of our greateſt Heroes, and ſent them packing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, <hi>and then whoſe are thoſe things that they leave behind?</hi> Yet Domination is ſo ſweet, many will venture Neck and all to attain it. <hi>Nero</hi>'s Mother, when ſhe was told that if her Son were <hi>Emperour,</hi> he would take away here Life, made Anſwer, She mattered not, ſo her Son might Reign: Which Prediction after fell out, her Son ript up her Bowels, that he might ſee the place of his Conception.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59683:115"/> ſhare. Ambition, like a Serpent, creeps into the Heart at a little hole, but is hardly got out: It crept into Heaven among the Angels, for ſome conceive they affected the Deity: It crept into <hi>Paradice,</hi> and made our firſt Parents deſire to know as God: The <hi>Babel</hi>-Builders they would fain dwell as God, and <hi>Antichriſt ſets himſelf above all that is called God, or is worſhipped.</hi> Every proud man is tainted with this Lunacy, and are diſcontent with the Station in which God hath placed them.

            <p>See what Ignorance may do: But Ignorance of God will prove the moſt dangerous miſtake. There are many in our Age like <hi>David</hi>'s Fool, <hi>that ſay in their Hearts, there is no God;</hi> nay, too many that proclaim it with their Tongues, but e're long they will be fain to eat their words: There is not one of them, but e're long will be fully convinc'd; for there is no Atheiſt in <hi>Hell,</hi> the Devil, though full of other Sins, is not guilty of this. Many here have Souls to little purpoſe, but like Salt, to keep their Bodies from Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for as they think there is no God, ſo they live as if there were none.

'Tis true, he was merciful when he drowned the old World, burnt <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with Fire, overthrew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Army in the Red-Sea, ſlew in one night in the Camp of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> 185000, and will be ſo at the day of Judgment, when he throws the Devil and his Angels, and all unrepenting Sinners, into <hi>Hell:</hi> And they will find him juſt, as well as merciful, and one that will make good his Threats, as well as his Promiſes; He hath Power in his Hand to do both, and will be no reſpecter of Perſons, for if they are wicked, by what Name or Titles ſoever they are dignified or diſtinguiſh'd, ſuffer they muſt. <hi>Tophet is ordained of old, even for the King it is prepared: He hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord, as a river of Brimſtone, doth kindle it,</hi> Iſa. 30.33.

But e're long God will ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me ye wicked, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 25.41.

Oh the numberleſs Number of bloody Bills will be brought in, and fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! not a vain word, or thought, or wanton glance of the Eye, or wicked or laſcivious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or Action, will be then omitted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; there they muſt ſtay till they have paid the utmoſt Farthing, for God will be no loſer by them: Thoſe that have exceeded moſt in Sin,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59683:125"/> ſhall exceed alſo in Torments, as God threatens <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18.15, 16. No Tongue can tell, nor Heart conceive, how great their Torments will be, for they will be inconceivable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable. If all the Tormenting Diſeaſes that ever poor Creature groaned under were inflicted upon one Man, and all the Racks and Tortures that ever were invented by Man or Devil, were added to it, and this Man's Life ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved under theſe Tortures for a Year, for a Hundred, or a Thouſand Years, ſure it would be a miſerable Spectacle: But what is this to Hell Torments? This reaches only the Body, except by Sympathy, when Soul and Body are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Hell. Or what is a Thouſand Years to Eternity? A thouſand thouſand rentings of the Soul from the Body, is not ſo much as one rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Soul and Body from God. There are many now that cannot endure to hear the Devil's Name in a Sermon, yet can they endure to lodge him in their Hearts; but how will they lodge with him for ever? If he now appear in ſome horrid ſhape, how are they affrighted out of their Wits, but how then will they dwell with him for Eternity? Now if a Perſon be in pain, they have ſome intervals, ſome mitigation, but there is none; or ſome parts of the Body free, when others are tormented; but in Hell no Part, Power, or Faculty is free, yet haply thoſe Parts that ſinned moſt, may ſuffer moſt, as the Rich Glutton's Tongue ſeemed to do; <hi>their fire goes not out, neither doth their worm dye:</hi> Every Senſe there will have its Torment, as every Senſe here hath its peculiar Sins. Whether the Fire there be Material, as ſome imagine, or Metaphorical, as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59683:126"/> others more probably conceive it, is not much material for us to know, and well if we never know; if it be Material Fire, God adds ſtrength to it, otherwiſe it could not touch the Soul; if Metaphorical Fire, 'tis ſomething more afflictive than our Imaginations can reach; however Chriſt bids us <hi>not fear man, that can but kill the body,</hi> (haply by Fire) <hi>but cannot kill the ſoul, but fear him that can caſt ſoul and body into Hell.</hi> Now our Fire conſumes as well as torments, but Hell Fire doth not ſo; Wicked Men in Hell are like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Buſh, always burning, but never conſumed; would Hell-fire conſume them it would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py News, but they are like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> they live in it, and will do to Eternity; they never leave ſinning, and their ſins are as Oyl or Pitch to increaſe the Flames, and God will not leave plaguing them for their ſins. <hi>Jerome</hi> tells us, their Sins are the Oyl, and God's Wrath the Fire, and while the Oyl is poured on, the Fire will not out. Thoſe Bodies that now are ſo tender they cannot endure Cold nor Heat, that muſt not have the Sun or Wind to ſee them, for ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Beauty, will be now expoſed to Fire and Flames; thoſe that could not away with an ill ſmell, what will they do to endure the ſmell of burning Brimſtone, or what is worſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by it? Thoſe that delighted in Pleaſant Sights and Shews, muſt here take up with the ſight of Infernal Fiends, and Leprous Souls, far more ugly than the fouleſt Toad that crawls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Feet; and the choiceſt Melody will be the Yellings, Roarings, and Blaſphemings of damned Devils, and miſcarrying Souls, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be felt but Fire, or what more is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59683:126"/> for further Torment. How will they <hi>dwell with everlaſting burning,</hi> that now cannot away with Summer-heat? Theſe Flames will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard Age, Sex, nor Beauty, but like the Worms will feed upon one as ſoon as the other; for as the Worms will make their Neſts between thoſe Breaſts that now are expoſed to ſhew, and ſale, and eat out thoſe wanton Windows of Love, and Meſſengers of Luſt, and ſeize upon the faireſt Face, as on the moſt deformed Piece; and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs will conſume that Hair, that now is made the Nets and Snares to catch our wanton Youth; and Prey upon the moſt Ambitious <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or proudeſt Perſon, as ſoon as any other, making no difference between the Prince and the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the Duſt of both will ere long be mixt, and not known aſunder; ſo in like manner will they go undiſtinguiſhed in the Infernal Pit, for God will reſpect no Man's Perſon in the Judgment, nor the Flames in Hell, but as their Work is, ſo will be their Reward. That there will be degrees in Torment, I think is out of doubt, for there are degrees in Sin, and the Judge of all the Earth will do Righteouſly; <hi>Thoſe that know their maſters will, and do it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes;</hi> thoſe that have abuſed moſt Talents, have moſt to anſwer for: <hi>It ſhall be eaſier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah <hi>in the day of Judgment, than for</hi> Corazin <hi>and</hi> Bethſaida. Bloody Perſecutors of Chriſt and his Church, are like to have the hotteſt place in Hell, and thoſe that commit that <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> ſhall ſpeed worſe than thoſe that ſin of frailty. Thoſe that now would be accounted Roaring Boys, will be ſuch indeed, when they come there, for Roaring and Yelling will be their beſt Muſick;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59683:127"/> and all ſhall dance after this Pipe, and bear a ſhare in this Conſort. Oh, that Men would be wiſe before it be too late, and Hell hath ſhut her Mouth upon them, for then they will have <hi>no reſt day nor night,</hi> but it is the duration that makes up the Miſery compleat: Did the Torments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but a Hundred, or a Thouſand Years, though it were long, yet it would be ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that an end would come, but the word <hi>Never,</hi> is a Hell in the midſt of Hell. Were a Man in perfect Health and Strength adjudged to lye upon a ſoft Feather Bed, without ſtirring Hand or Foot, for a Year's ſpace, though he had the comfort of Friends, Meat, Drink, and other Neceſſaries, it would be thought a great Puniſhment, much more if he lay upon a red-hot Gridiron, and could be preſerved with Life: But what is either of theſe to Hell-Torments, or a Year to Eternity? But their Torment muſt run parallel with the Life of God, the days of Heaven, and the longeſt line of Eternity; and when they have paſt as many Thouſand Millions of Years as there are Piles of Graſs upon the Earth, Stars in Heaven, Hairs upon Man &amp; Beaſts, Sands upon the Sea-ſhore, Feathers upon all Fowl, and Scales and Fins upon all Fiſh, yet will their Miſery be no whit abated, or any nearer to an end than the firſt day they were caſt into it; for were this innumerable Number taken from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it is never the leſs. Oh, Eternity! Eternity! who can judge of thee, or find thee out? If the Earth were converted into Paper, and the Sea into Ink, and every Graſs-pile into Pens, and every Sand upon the Sea-ſhore were a skilful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetician, and all of them with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59683:127"/> Labours, when they had caſt up their greateſt Sums, and added them together, yet would it not reach Eternity: Nay, if the whole Firmament were written from end to end with Arithmetical Figures, it would fall ſhort. Oh, what then but Horror and Deſpair will ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on miſcarrying Souls! when all their hopes are daſh'd, then will they ſeek Death, but ſhall not find it: Oh, that theſe pains would break my Heart, and end my Life, ſay they. Oh, that I might at laſt be extinct, or that theſe Infernal Spirits would tear me in pieces, till they had rent me to nothing. Oh, that I had never had a Being! curſed be my Father that begat me, and the Womb that bare me; curſed be thoſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of mine, that helped to undo me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me into my Enemies hands. Such as theſe are like to be the wiſhes that Eternity will extract from tormented Souls. O that the conſideration thereof would make Men wiſe before it be too late! But if Death find us unprepared, this that I have deſcribed will be our condition for ever, which God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 6. The Sixth Leſſon that this Providence teacheth us, is this, That ſeeing this our Friend is taken away in the midſt of her days, in her full ſtrength, while <hi>her breaſts were full of milk, and her bones moiſtened with marrow,</hi> Job 21.24. This teacheth all, but eſpecially us that are of greater Age, that ſurvive her, how neceſſary 'tis for us to make Preparation for our own Death; for if God deal thus with the green Tree, what ſhall be done to the dry? Young Men may dye, Old Men muſt dye; for <hi>we know neither the day,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59683:128"/> nor the hour wherein our Lord and Maſter will come,</hi> 'Tis good therefore to watch every day, and every hour; we know not when he will ſend his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to us to Command us <hi>to give an account of our Steward-ſhip, for we ſhall be no longer Stewards.</hi> We uſually ſay, That ſhould be well done, that can be but once done; but we can dye but once, <hi>'tis appointed unto all men once to dye, and after death the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Here is no room for a ſecond Error, as we ſay in War. <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo it lyes, whether to the North, or to the South;</hi> ſo, as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment ſhall find us. Now, Death is no Fear-babe, <hi>tis the King of Terrors,</hi> and a Terror to Kings. Hell is no Scare-crow, neither Eternity a Jeſting matter, the Soul that is in danger, is no Trifle, but our chiefeſt Jewel, and Salvation and Damnation are matters of Moment, things of great Concern. Now, a Man would think that in Matters of ſuch Concern it were not needful to uſe many words to make us mind it, when we are earneſt enough in leſſer matters, but 'tis evident we are all faulty in ſome degree or other, and the moſt altogether negligent. Were but our Houſes on fire over our heads, we need not many Arguments to ſeek to ſave our ſelves, and to quench the Fire. Were we in danger of Drowning, we need not many Arguments to perſwade us to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething or other to help us out. Were we purſued with an implacable Enemy that ſought our Lives, or with a roaring Lion, or ranging Bear, we ſhould double our Diligence, and amend our Pace, and uſe all means to eſcape the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And is the Soul ſo contemptible a thing, that we matter it ſo little? It is (without our
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59683:128"/> Diligence prevent it) in danger to be drown'd in the Lake of Perdition, and to be burnt in the Fire that never goes out, and is purſued with thoſe Infernal Furies, that ſeek to devour her; and yet we make but a little haſt to reſcue her: But are our Houſes, our Eſtates, our Bodies, or our Lives to be preferred before the Immortal Soul, the beſt part of Man? And is a Moment of Time more to us than Eternity? Do we take ſo much care what to eat, and what to drink, and wherewith to be cloathed, and ſo little how the Soul is fed or cloathed, decked or adorned? This doubtleſly would beſpeak our Folly. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the World dream or ſay to the contrary, Heaven will be found to the Poſſeſſors of it a real Happineſs; and whatever Coſt or Charge, Pains or Labour we beſtow, a good Peny-worth; and Hell will be found a real Miſery, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have into the Bargain, we ſhall be loſers; the Rich Glutton found it ſo, and many more; here <hi>the worm dyes not, and the fire never goes out.</hi> One day in Heaven will make us forget all our Miſeries on Earth; and one day in Hell will make us forget all our fore-paſt Pleaſures. Now, while we are unprepared for Death, there is but the thread of our Lives between us and endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs Torments; and this muſt needs be an uneaſie condition to a conſiderate Man. And which makes it the worſe, Death is always gnawing at this thread, which if once broken, all the World cannot piece it, or yield us any relief. Now, in ſerious matters wiſe men ſhould be ſerious; Beggars, when their wants are ſerious, they will leave their Canting, and beg in earneſt, as alſo a Priſoner that begs for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59683:129"/> his Life, and is not the life of the Soul of greater value? 'Tis the Immortal Soul that lyes at the ſtake, while we are playing a Game at Folly. God is in earneſt, his Meſſengers are in earneſt, and ſhall we, who are moſt concerned, and who are like to be the greateſt loſers, be in jeſt? Were it our Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, or ſuch like, that were in danger, the matter were not much, but 'tis the Soul, and need not we be in earneſt? But ſeeing 'tis for Souls, I ſhall back this Exhortation with theſe following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider ſeriouſly that we muſt dye, but when we know not; 'tis our Wiſdom to have Death always in our Eye, and with the Apoſtle, <hi>to dye daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. Death comes never the ſooner for our Preparation for it, neither ſtays the longer if we expect it not; the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thoughts of it will put us on to our Duty, when <hi>the putting far from us the evil day, Amos</hi> 6.3. will make us neglect it. This curſed Security and hope of Impunity is the ſource of all the Wickedneſs in the World, <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is wholly ſet in them to do wickedly,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. But this is not preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a reſervation to a greater Evil; this Forbearance is no Acquittance, whatever we think of it, Death is ſtealing upon us <hi>tacito pede</hi> with a ſilent foot, and how ſoon he will enter our Lodgings we know not, and then the Play is ended, and we muſt march off the Stage. This Motive haply may ſeem needleſs, to mind Men of what they all know already, but I think 'tis not uſeleſs; for though all Men will eaſily
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59683:129"/> confeſs they muſt dye, yet 'tis not eaſie to make them conſider of it, or believe their Death is near; nay, if we look upon moſt mens Actions, and manner of Living, 'tis eaſie to conclude, that neither God nor Death are in their thoughts. Were we but ſure that Chriſt would come to Judgment within a Month, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t a Reformation ſhould we ſee in the World? Our Time-waſting Gallants would not then ſpend ſo much time in Hawking, Hunting, Drinking, Whoring, as now they do; Holineſs would not then be their ſcorn, nor Religion their reproach, and yet who knows whether it may not be within a Week? Or could we be aſſured that Death would then Summon us to <hi>render an account of our Steward-ſhip</hi> in ſo ſhort a time, it would make the proudeſt of us to vail our Peacocks Plumes, and entertain other thoughts of Death and Judgment, and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than at preſent we have; and we ſhould not be ſo prodigal of our time, as now we are; but ſpend more of our time in hearing, reading, meditating, and other Religious Exerciſes, than now we do. So that 'tis the vain hopes of long Life, which God never promiſed to any, that encourages many in their wickedneſs, and makes the Godly themſelves the more ſecure; 'tis good therefore to view our Charter, and ſee what time is granted us, and not like the unfaithful Servant, <hi>ſay, My Lord deferreth his coming, &amp;c.</hi> leſt he come unawares, and give us a Reward of our Folly; the Poet ſhews theſe mens Folly, that future their Repentance upon hopes of long life.</p>

            <p>Many would weep and lament did they know they had but a Month to live, that now laugh and rejoyce, not having a day to live; of this ſort was the Rich Man, mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O vain World! how doſt thou cheat us? O cunning Devil! how doſt thou delude us, and hide from our Eyes our latter end? How dare any Poor Man, that hath not made his Peace with his God, neither hath any aſſurance of his Love, ſpend an hour in an Ale-houſe, or a day in Vanity, and not know but it is his laſt? We have many Spectacles of Mortality daily before us, younger and ſtronger than we go to the Grave before us, and many Monitors of Mortality within us, Pains and Aches, Griefs and Troubles, even gray Hairs, to mind us of our Winding-ſheets. The Lord grant we may <hi>know the voice of the rod, and of him that ſends it.</hi> The Rich Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16. promiſes himſelf a laſting Happineſs in the World, when he had not a day to live; and no doubt we have many ſuch in our Times: But alas, one Month, or one Year, for ought we know may make a great and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable alteration in our Families, and haply thoſe may be taken away that thought they had many a fair Year to live, and much Worldly Happineſs to enjoy. Sometimes Death ſtrikes the Child in the Womb, when he ſpares them that ſtoop for Age; there is no Degree, Age, or Sex, that is ſecure; neither Rich nor Poor, Noble nor Baſe, Young nor Old, Fair nor Foul, Religious nor Profane, can plead an Exemption from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Death, for all of us <hi>are duſt, and unto duſt we muſt return,</hi> Gen. 3.19. Eccleſ. 12.7. Thoſe Houſes of Clay wherein we live will ere
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59683:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> long moulder into duſt about our Ears, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 'Tis our Wiſdom therefore to look out for another Habitation, <hi>a building, an houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and builder is God.</hi> This Life of ours, for the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of it, is compared unto the moſt fleeting, fading, periſhing things we can name; as to Graſs, to the Flower of the Field, a Bubble, a Poſt, a Weaver's Shuttle, a Thought, a Shadow, the dream of a Shadow, or if any thing be more vain, and <hi>what manner of men then ought we to be?</hi> 1 Pet. 3.11. The dimneſs of our Eyes, the deafneſs of our Ears, the rottenneſs of our Teeth, the wrinkles in our Cheeks, the feebleneſs of our Limbs, and every decay in Nature, warns us of our approaching ends; Death ſhoots many Darts at us, and at length will hit us to the heart. It was <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>'s fault and folly, and I wiſh it be not ours, to <hi>forget our latter end,</hi> Lam. 1.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Let us further conſider that we have a great deal of Work to do before we can be fit to dye, and but a little, ſhort, uncertain time to do it in, and therefore more Diligence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and 'tis work of the greateſt Concernment; if our time were in our own power, and at our own diſpoſe, ſure and certain; or were our Work but a little, or of little concern whether it were or no, it might be ſome excuſe to us for our Idleneſs, and Time-waſting; but this is not our caſe. Were Pleaſures the end why we were ſent into the World, as many of our Gallants of both Sexes ſeem to ſuppoſe, then many in our times take an effectual courſe, but endleſs Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they mind not, the way to Heaven will
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59683:131"/> prove a little rougher. God ſent us into the World upon an higher Errand; our lives, and the life of our Souls, yea, our Eternal weal or woe depends upon the well or ill ſpending of this little Inch of Time: And are not thoſe mad, or worſe, that conſume it in Folly and Vanity? Moſt Men live as if they had no concerns of another World to mind, as if their Work were done, and nothing remained but to receive their Wages, but I fear this is few mens caſe. Had we a blood-thirſty Enemy to encounter, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our Blood would ſatisfie, we ſhould be more concerned to keep us out of his hands; but the Devil is ſuch a one, <hi>that walks about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Were we in a Journey for our Lives, or in a Race, that if we won not, we muſt dye, how diligently ſhould we run, and take all advantages, and caſt our ground? This is our caſe, we were ſent to run a Race, Heaven is the Prize we run for, our Souls lye at the ſtake, if we run not <hi>ſo as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> they will be loſt, and lodge in the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pit for ever; and ſhall we leave our way, and hunt after Butter-flies, eſpecially ſetting out ſo late? And our day is almoſt ſpent, and <hi>the ſhadows of the evening are ſtretched out.</hi> There is much out of order in the Soul, which muſt of neceſſity be rectified; our ſtony Hearts muſt be changed for Hearts of fleſh, and this is no eaſie work; the Soul muſt be <hi>regenerated and born again,</hi> or we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Corruptions muſt be mortified, and the power of Sin abated, and the Soul ſanctified, or no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven; <hi>for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter there.</hi> There muſt be Oyl in the Veſſel, Grace
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59683:131"/> in the Heart, as well as the Lamps of Profeſſion in the Hand, or the Door will be ſhut againſt us, as it was againſt the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will be in vain for us to thruſt into the Bride-Chamber if we have not on a <hi>Wedding-garment,</hi> for we ſhall he diſcovered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. The Graces of God's Spirit muſt be had, for theſe are the Gems and Jewels that adorn the Soul, and make it comely in the Eyes of God; for <hi>no unrighteous man ſhall ever enter Heaven.</hi> Holineſs is Chriſt's Sheep-mark, and whoſoever wants it ſhall ſtand at Chriſt's left hand: The Old Man muſt be crucified with his deeds, and the New Man put on, and the body of Sin muſt be deſtroyed. Faith, Hope, and Charity muſt not be wanting, neither Repentance, new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Self-denyal, Humility, and other Soul-adorning Graces, which God hath made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. The Combat of the Spirit againſt the Fleſh muſt be maintained, and no Peace or Truce had with the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; for when we make Peace with thoſe, we break our Peace with God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve two ſuch Maſters. We muſt be <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world, and the world to us.</hi> Religion muſt be practiſed as well as profeſs'd, or our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will do us little good; the moſt gainful, pleaſureful, and beſt beloved ſins, though as dear as a right Hand, or right Eye, muſt not only be left, but hated, though Cuſtom, Education, or Carnal Intereſt hath endeared them to us; and the moſt painful, difficult, dangerous, coſtly Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt be done when God requires them, and that in a Spiritual manner. All God's Commands muſt be obeyed, how croſs ſoever they are to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59683:132"/> Fleſh and Blood. A conſtant Watch muſt be kept over the Heart, to keep the Thoughts in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and the Affections in order, as alſo over our Lips, <hi>that we offend not with our tongues.</hi> We muſt live ſo uprightly to Men, and ſo holily to God, that our Enemies may have nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt us, but concerning the Law of our God. Our Thoughts, Words, and Actions muſt be regulated by the Word of God. Chriſt muſt be loved with a prevailing degree of Love, yea, above either Mother, Wife, and Children, and our own Lives. Our Wills muſt be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Will of God, and we muſt deny our ſelves for his ſake, and forſake all if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Our greateſt Enemies we muſt love, forgive, and pray for; and nothing muſt poſſeſs the beſt Room in our Hearts but Chriſt.

Now, this is ſome of the Work we have to do; in a word, conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt in the ſeveral Duties he Commands in publick, private, and in ſecret, muſt be maintained, if we would be fit to dye; and can we think then we have any time to ſpare to throw away upon needleſs Recreations?

'Tis the Devil's Language to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men they have yet long to live, many fair Summers to ſee, and that there is time enough yet, and if the worſt come to the worſt, a few good words at laſt will waft them over ſafe to Heaven; but theſe, e're long, will hear the Doom of the fooliſh Rich man, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, and then whoſe are theſe? Luk.</hi> 12.19, 20. He was ſhot with the Bolt while he gazed at the Bow.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Devil's Policy to perſwade us we have ſome time yet to ſpend in his Service, and enough for God beſide; but let us beware of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, till we have better aſſurance than the Devil can give us. Many that have done more for Heaven, and can ſay more for it than moſt of us, have had Heaven Gates barr'd againſt them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.12, <hi>&amp;c. Many will ſay in that day, Have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? yet he ſhall ſay, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I know you not.</hi> Many ſpeak like Saints, live like Devils, they have <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſmooth Tongue, but <hi>Eſau</hi>'s rough Hands. Many live and dye in a Self-deluſion, and go to Hell with Hopes of Heaven in their Mouths. Many young men are in Hell, that thought to repent when they were old; and many old men, that ſuppoſed they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59683:133"/> ſhould live longer; but many bear themſelves in hand, they can do as the Thief did, do the Devil's Work all day, and receive Wages of Chriſt at night; but this is a deſperate Venture, the Judge haply ſaves one Malefactor of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and every man thinks it will be he. <hi>Legi &amp; perlegi ſcripturam, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I have read the Scripture over and over, yet did I never read but of one that was ſaved upon late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when an Hundred thouſand hare miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And ſaith another, We may as rationally expect our Aſs to ſpeak, becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs did once ſpeak, as to imagine to follow this ſingular Example. To put off Repeneance upon ſuch an account, is, ſaith a third, as bold a Venture as for a man to go a great Journey without Money, becauſe another did ſo, and found a Purſe of Money in his way. If a way be difficult, and ſcarce one of an hundred find it, is it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption for us, if we travail that Road without Enquiry?</p>
            <p>The greateſt Politicians, and thoſe that have been able to deceive and put a Cheat upon others, have in this buſineſs been deceived; as <hi>Haman, Achitophel,</hi> and many others. The moſt learned and profound Scholars have here been miſtaken, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the greateſt Philoſophers, Jeſuites, and many learned Doctors in our Age; And ſhall we think our ſelves ſecure? Yea, thoſe that have directed others in the way, and put them on to prepare, yea, to make haſte in their Journey, have for want of Preparation and Haſte, fallen ſhort of their deſired Journeys end. Thus the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and Doctors of the Law, <hi>that bound heavy burdens, and grievous
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59683:133"/> to be born, and laid them on mens ſhoulders, yet would not touch them with one of their fingers.</hi> Many of thoſe that have lived under the ſearching means of Grace, and have had many a rouzing Sermon, many a Direction, Exhortation, and Reproof, have yet miſcarried. Thus <hi>Judas, Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Demas</hi> and others, that fell ſhort; yea, thoſe that had Chriſt himſelf and his Diſciples for their Teachers, as <hi>Capernaum, Choraſin,</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida.</hi> Many Miniſters are like the Signs at the Ale-houſe-door, they ſhew others where they may have ſhelter, but they themſelves abide in the Rain; or like the Builders of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, make a Ship to ſave others, when they themſelves periſh in the Flood. 'Tis good therefore to look about us, leſt this be our condition.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Conſ.</hi> Let us farther conſider the daily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we are in while we remain in an unprepared condition to dye, for if Death find us thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, we are undone for ever, paſt hopes of help or means of recovery, for we ſhall inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loſe the Soul, which is the moſt precious Jewel we have, which in Chriſt's Account is more worth than the World it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 26. <hi>What is a man profited if he gain the whole world and leſt his own ſoul? Or, what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoul?</hi> Intimating, that the loſs is both irrecoverable and irreparable. And is it nothing to loſe an immortal Soul, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an ever-living Death? Thoſe that are ſenſible of Loſſes and Croſſes in the World, ſhall they be inſenſible of the great Loſs? A thouſand thouſand rendings of the Soul from the Body is not equivalent to one rending of the Soul and Body from God; other Loſſes may be ſupplied,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59683:134"/> or at leaſt ſuffer'd, but this Loſs is inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unſufferable: Riches, Honours, Friends, and other Earthly Enjoyments may be loſt, and yet recover'd, or at leaſt the Loſs more eaſily born, but the Loſs of the Soul is incomparable. Oh, what dreadful Thoughts and Apprehenſions will ſurprize a miſcarrying Soul, when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends her ſelf lanching forth into an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean of Eternity, yea, an infinite Ocean of boiling Lead and burning Brimſtone, or what is far more formidable, there to ſwim to all Eternity in endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs Torments! then farewel all Earthly Delights, all comfortable Relations, all true Friends, all Recreations and Pleaſures, all Friends and Favourites, yea, God himſelf, the Chief of all, which will then prove an invincible irreconcileable Enemy; then the Devil, who hath long look'd for his Prey, ſhall have it, and here that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Take him Jaylor;</hi> the poor Soul muſt receive then her due deſerved Wages, for her faithful Service to her Infernal Maſter, even everlaſting Torments World without end. Oh, what amazing thoughts will then meet the Soul in Hell, to think that God, and Heaven, and Happineſs are irrecoverably loſt, and all her other Hopes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and Support gone, and her ſelf undone for ever, and that ſhe muſt everlaſtingly lye in thoſe eternal Flames, without hope of Redemption! This word <hi>[Ever]</hi> will be a Hell in the midſt of Hell, to think that Pain and Anguiſh, Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Wailing, will be her Portion as long as God is God, even for ever and for ever, and that Weeping it ſelf will now be in vain.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59683:134"/>
            <p>Now this is the preſent condition of an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Soul, and the Lord knows, this is moſt mens caſe, however the Devil and their own Hearts perſwade them to the contrary. If we are in this condition, there is but a Thread between us and infernal Flames, even the Thread of our Lives, and how ſoon Death may cut it we know not; a thouſand Darts Death throws at us, even every Diſeaſe, Pain, Ach, Grief, and Trouble, and when he will hit us to the Heart the Lord only knows, and then the Soul will be in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition, which Eternity it ſelf cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Our Glaſs is alwaies running, and when the laſt Sand drops we know not; the <hi>Ephah</hi> of our Sins is alwaies filling, and when it will be full, and our Iniquities ripe, we know not; if it be before our Repentance prevent it, we are in a worſe caſe than the Beaſts that periſh, whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries end with their Lives, when ours begin at out Death; they only pay that Debt of Nature, but we muſt pay the utmoſt farthing; they go to their Grave, but we to Priſon, then ſhall we alſo loſe our God with our Souls, or at leaſt all comfortable relation to him, for we ſhall ſtill have him as an irreconcileable Enemy; all our Earthly Enjoyments, all which now we take for our Happineſs, will then be gone, and the Portion which we choſe will be ſnatch'd from us, and in room of this, a Portion in Hell will be aſſigned us, where fiery whips of fierceſt Fiends will eternally torment us, who being tormented themſelves, have no other Pleaſure but in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting others; and if all the Torments that ever were invented by Man or Devil, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this, it would fall far ſhort: But the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59683:135"/> Duration of theſe Torments is that which makes them compleat; for if a Thouſand thouſand millions of Years were ſubſtracted, the Sum is ne'er the leſs. Oh, how much then doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove us to look about us, leſt that day come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us at unawares.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Conſ.</hi> Let us further conſider, that Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death, that is, getting thoſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for dying perſons: An Intereſt in Chriſt, and a Title to Glory, cleared up to us, can do us no hurt, but will do us good, and is worth all the Pains and Coſt we can be at about it; but the neglect of it is, as you have heard, dangerous and deadly: Our Pains and Coſt which we are at about it will not be loſt, but well recompenſed, and never any one was made miſerable by it; when Ten thouſand times ten thouſand have been undone by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Death comes never the ſooner when 'tis expected, or to thoſe that with the Apoſtle <hi>dye daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15:31. neither will it ſpare men the more becauſe they put it out of their ſight, <hi>And they put far off the evil day,</hi> Amos 6.3. no, no, <hi>the Lord of ſuch ſervants ſhall come in a day they know not of, and in an hour they are not aware of.</hi> Death is not blind, though we wink; he that is fit to dye, is fit to live, and truly no other, for the ſame Qualifications ſerve for the one and for the other: He that is prepared for Death needs not to fear it, and he that fears not Death, needs fear no Enemy, no, though the whole Creation were turned into Lyons and Bears, yea, incarnate Devils about him, kill him they may, hurt him they cannot, the worſt they can do, is to ſend him to his Father's Houſe the ſooner: If we are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59683:135"/> prepared, Death may ſtrike us, but cannot ſting us, for the ſting is taken out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. and if it take us away by the Hand of Violence, Twenty years in Heaven will make amends for Twenty years upon Earth, which we might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have lived; and if we receive as much Wages for half a day, as other for the whole, what cauſe is there of Complaint? When our Debt to Nature is paid, our Work is done, and our Reſt follows; when we have been threſhed, fifted, and winnowed, and the Chaff blown away, we ſhall be laid up as good Corn in our Father's Grainary; when <hi>the Tares ſhall be bundl'd up,</hi> Swearers with Swearers, Drunkards with Drunkards, and one Adulterer with another, and <hi>caſt into unquenchable fire;</hi> when we have Oyl in our Veſſels, as well as Lamps in our Hands, then we ſhall enter in with the Bridegroom, when the reſt ſhall be ſhut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he that comes in without a Wedding-Garment on his Back, ſhall not go out without Bolts on his Heels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Take him, bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into outward darkneſs:</hi> He muſt go from the Table to the Tormentor.</p>
            <p>But many other are the Benefits that flow from a right Preparation for Death, yea, more than can be numbred, for our Evidences cleared up, will be a Heaven upon Earth, and will ſweeten every Condition, how bitter ſoever in it ſelf, and hold up the Head above Water, and the Heart from fainting under the ſaddeſt Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that can befal us, and makes a Chriſtian ſee Light in the darkeſt Cloud, and read Love in God's Face in his ſaddeſt Frowns; for Grace in the Heart, and unblurred Evidences thereof,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59683:136"/> without which we cannot be prepared to dye, will be ſuch an Antidote to keep the Heart from ſinking, that the World it ſelf cannot make up ſuch a Cordial; nothing can come amiſs to ſuch a Soul, for he knows the ſame Love that elected him, and ſent Chriſt into the <hi>World</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him, is now on work for his good: If he meet with Afflictions, he can ſuck Sweetneſs thence, and gather Arguments of God's Love from it, and conclude thence, that he is <hi>not a Baſtard, but a Son, for God correcteth thoſe he loves, and ſcourgeth every ſon that he receiveth and thoſe that are without correction are baſtards, and not ſons,</hi> Heb. 12.7, 8. Afflictions are the Gemms and Jewels that God adorneth his beſt Friends with: He had one Son without Sin, but none without Sorrow, and it be thoſe that <hi>ſuffer with him that muſt reign with him.</hi> If a prepared Chriſtian meet with Proſperity, he can read Love in this alſo, and take every Mercy as a Love-token, and admire the Goodneſs of God to ſuch a poor Wretch. If he read or hear the Word of God, he can ſuck Sweetneſs from every Paſſage, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precepts, Promiſes or Threats; his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, of Glory, will be ſweet; his Morning Thoughts and Evening Meditations alſo; many a Cordial can he fetch from the meditation of thoſe inviſible things, which others have no Converſe with, no Deſire after; and this bears up the Heart from ſinking in the worſt of Times, as it did the Martyrs Hearts in Priſons, Loſſes, yea, at the Stake it ſelf; for how can it be but a ſerious thought of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Glory, and a firm believing that he hath an Intereſt in them,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59683:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> but it muſt cheer up the Heart? And will not the reading the precious Promiſes of God, and knowing alſo that they are their Father's Legacy to them, choſe but warm the Heart? Yea, the thoughts of Death, as 'tis a Meſſenger ſent from God, to bring us to <hi>Glory,</hi> and ſet an end to all our <hi>Miſeries,</hi> will hardly be much ſweetned, for many diſmal Apprehenſions may an unprepared Soul well have of Death, but to the other the Sting is taken out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55.</p>
            <p>In a word, happy is the condition of a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Soul, and therefore 'tis our Intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it.</p>
            <p>Thus, Madam, having ſhewn what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we may and ought to make of ſuch ſad Providences as are now under our conſideration, the laſt I mention'd was, preparing for our own Death: And, oh that my ſelf were effectually perſwaded ſo to do, by the convincing Motive I have laid down: I ſhall add ſome Directions in reference to Preparation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Direct.</hi> If we deſign and deſire to dye hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and comfortably, let us get an Intereſt in Chriſt, and a Title to Glory, clear'd up to the Soul, for thoſe that muſt cheerfully and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave all their Earthly Enjoyments, Comforts, and Relations, had need of aſſurance of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the World is; for who would leave a certain Good for an uncertainty? one Bird in the Hand, they ſay, is worth two in the Buſh.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59683:137"/>
            <p>'Tis true, a man may have a Title to Glory when Aſſurance is wanting; and this man may dye happily, though not comfortably, for Death to him muſt needs look ghaſtly. Till a man can look upon Chriſt the Rich Pearl as his own, how can he part with all for him? But when he hath Chriſt, and Heaven, and Glory in his Eyes, he matters not what he parts with for them; he knows 'tis a good Bargain, who will not part with Pebbles for Pearls, with Earth for Heaven, and the Creature for God; ſuch, and ſuch alone can look Death undauntedly in the Face. Till a man find the Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant within him, what Comfort can he have in the Covenant it ſelf? Though the King grant Pardon to a thouſand Malefactors, if I be a Malefactor, and cannot prove that I am of this number, what Comfort can I take from the Grant? But when the Qualifications are found in the Soul, which God hath made neceſſary to Salvation, and to which Heaven and Happineſs is promiſed, when the ſanctifying, regenerating, and adopting Works of the Spirit appears there, and the Graces of it are found, when God's Sheep-mark of Holineſs is there impreſſed, this muſt needs be refreſhing to the Soul. I know that full Aſſurance, ſo as to ſet a man above all doubting, the higheſt Pinacle of Aſſurance, that <hi>maximum quod ſic,</hi> beyond which nothing but coeleſtial Enjoyment can be expected, is ſo rare a Jewel, that it adorns the Head or Heart of few. Many in the World, <hi>David</hi> himſelf was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſeek, and God's beſt Servants at a loſs, but yet through Mercy, a comfortable Aſſurance, to keep the Heart from deſpairing or deſponding,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59683:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath been and is given unto many of the Godly, yet not without great Pains and Diligence, much Examination, and fervent Prayer. We are not in this caſe to look into God's ſecret Cabinet of his Decrees and Councils, to know whether we are elected or no, for if we can find the effects of Electing Love, and the Graces of the Spirit of God, which none wear, but the Spouſe of Chriſt, we may conclude the Marriage is conſummate, and we may ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his, Cant.</hi> 6.3. I am ſure he is mine, and I can boldly ſpeak it, her Faith is unfeigned, and her Love unfailable, ſhe had got a full gripe of of Chriſt, and is ſure nothing can ſeparate them; Chriſt lays hold upon her by his Spirit, and ſhe lays hold of Chriſt by Faith; ſhe hath made a total reſignation of her ſelf to him, and I accept of him in all his Offices and Efficacies; (ſaith ſhe) he hath given me that which he beſtows upon no other, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore I am ſure he loves me.</p>
            <p>The like may we ſay when we find the like Tokens of his Love; and when we find the firſt Steps of the Spirit in the Soul, we may conclude he hath been there.</p>
            <p>Now, this Aſſurance, however ſome men va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it not, is more comfortable both in Life and Death than the World can procure, 'tis Heaven upon Earth, and a Cordial againſt the Fear of Death. 'Tis an Encouragement to work, when we know we ſhall have good Wages, and to ſuffer Loſs, when we know we ſhall gain by our Loſſes; but without ſome comfortable Aſſurance we cannot look upon Death without Horror, and may ſay of it as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou found me, O my Enemy?</hi> When a man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59683:138"/> himſelf lanching forth into an infinite Ocean of Eternity, and knows not but it may be endleſs, who in his right Wits would not tremble? Though Grace be preſent, Comfort will be abſent, if Aſſurance be wanting. What good did <hi>Hagar</hi>'s Well of Water do her when ſhe ſaw it not; or <hi>Marys</hi> Diſcourſe with Chriſt, when ſhe knew him not? What Comfort will a Pardon give to a Malefactor at the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, if it be concealed? In Worldly Buſineſs we are not ſo careleſs to leave all at Uncertainty, and muſt the Soul only be neglected? Shall we lye in Debt, and not know of any Surety to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, and have Souls and not know what will come of them to Eternity?</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Dir.</hi> If ever we intend to dye happily, we muſt ſee Sin dead before us, for the Soul and Sin cannot live together, but they will be the death of the one, or of the other. Now Sin is never kill'd till it be hated, and looked upon as the moſt deadly Enemy, for who will kill one that he loves? 'Tis Sin that is the <hi>Sting of Death,</hi> which otherwiſe would be hurtleſs and harmleſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>Oh death, where is thy ſting? oh grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the boldeſt and braveſt Challenge that ever rung in Death's Ear, wherein the Apoſtle bids him do his worſt, for when Sin is dead, his Poyſon is gone; he may buz about our Ears as a drove Bee, and haply fright us, but cannot hurt us; he may ſtrike us, but cannot ſting us; he may, like <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his Locks were ſhorn, go forth as at other times, and ſhake himſelf, but his ſtrength
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59683:138"/> is gone, the worſt he can do, is but to ſend us to our Father's Houſe the ſooner. Sin, in ſtinging Chriſt, loſt his Sting, Chriſt overcame him, and took from him the Weapons he truſted in, and now we may hug the Serpent in our Boſom. Sin, when 'tis alive, ſets a Bar in Heaven-gate againſt us, and makes it impoſſible for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>for no unrighteous perſon, nor unclean thing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that defileth or worketh abomination ſhall ever enter, Rev.</hi> 21.27. no dirty Dog ſhall ever tread upon the Pavement. And as it ſhuts Heaven-gates, ſo it opens Hell-gates for us, and Death, as a Porter, will let us in. Sin is the only Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon with which the Devil can hurt us, and this Weapon we our ſelves put into his Hands; they are Snares of our own making, with which he entangles us; Cords of our own twiſting he leads us Captive in, for there is nothing elſe in the World that can make the Soul miſcarry; and this is our Miſery, we naturally delight in thoſe Fetters in which he holds us, and glory in our own Slavery. The Devil ſhews us Sin thro' his own Spectacles, and by his Paint and Plaſter that ſeems amiable which really is the moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and deformed thing, which really makes the Soul the moſt ugly, deformed, leprous thing in the World; but did we ſee our ſelves in this Dreſs, we ſhould come trembling into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, with Tears in our Eyes, Shame in our Faces, Sorrow in our Hearts, and Confeſſion in our Mouths; and if Sin look not with ſuch an Aſpect upon us, 'tis a ſign 'tis living, and not dead in us, for a dead Carcaſs cannot be lovely. When a Believer's Sin is mortified, he behaves himſelf to it as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the King towards <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59683:139"/> who had been his greateſt Favourite, and whom he had advanc'd next to himſelf in the Kingdom, he hates the ſight of him, and cannot endure him in his preſence, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.7. it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him that he had loſt his Love upon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Wretch: Even ſo a Believer mourns, that ever he entertain'd ſuch a treacherous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion as Sin in his Boſom; he deals by Sin as the Father of a rebellious Son was commanded to do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 21.18. lays the firſt Hand upon it, and throws the firſt Stone at it; he bears ſo an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable a Hatred to it, that nothing will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him but its Hearts Blood; he is not ſatisfied, as too many are, to lay it aſleep, but dye it muſt, he doth not lop off here a Bough, and there a Branch, but ſtocks up the very Root; he is not raking at the Channel, but cleanſing the very Fountain; he knows Sin is his greateſt Enemy, and therefore he will make no Peace or Truce with it; 'tis his greateſt Trouble he meets with in the World, that he cannot be quite rid of it, that he cannot give it a Bill of Divorce, and put it away; he deals with it as <hi>Amnon</hi> did by <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> whom before he ſo luſtfully loved, yet after hated her much more: So deals he by Sin, what he had luſtfully, wickedly loved, now he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly hates; he hates Sin in all, but eſpecially in himſelf, and flees the very <hi>appearance of Evil,</hi> and reſiſts it in the firſt motion, and as the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon Children, while they are young, and the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice Egg e're it be hatched,</hi> reſiſts the Temptation, and firſt Notion of Sin: and if the Devil foiſt in a Temptation, he like the raviſhed Virgin cries out for Help, ſuppreſſeth Sin in the Thoughts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever it appear in the Word or Action; as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59683:139"/>

The Heart is the Source of Sin, and the Fountain of Folly, and ſwarms with Luſts as a Carrion with Vermine; inward Bleeding will kill as well as outward, and from within Wickedneſs proceeds, but a man is never fit to dye, till Sin be kill'd and the Heart cleanſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Dir.</hi> The World alſo is an Enemy that muſt be ſubdued, if we would dye well or willingly; for the love of the World breaks many a Match between Chriſt and the Soul, and 'tis the uſual Bait the Devil lays, to keep us in his Snares; <hi>All this I will give thee;</hi> and 'tis a rare man that is not hereby alured: And therefore it was not in vain that the Apoſtle gives us this Caution, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And another Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God; whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> Can a Woman love two Husbands, or a Man ſerve two Maſters, God and Mammon? And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>The world is crucified to him, and he to the world:</hi> It cares not a Pin for me, and I care not a Ruſh for it; there is no more delight in it in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than there is in a dead Carcaſs, have it

It hangs out her two Breaſts, Strumpet like, of Profit and Pleaſure, but the Apoſtle had no mind to ſuck at theſe Botches; and if we would dye well, let us imitate him that had <hi>learnt to dye dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and get our Affections as much weaned from the World as poſſibly may be, and ſet upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, or 'tis ten to one it will ſpeak to us in the Words of <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Save thy ſelf.</hi> Whenever we ſhould come to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt, we may find what a ſnare it will be to us, as to the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.22. that bid fair for Chriſt, till the World came and broke the Bargain; he came to Chriſt haſtily, and departs heavily; when he muſt part with his Riches, he chuſes rather to part with Chriſt, and if Heaven will be had upon no cheaper terms, let him keep it to himſelf.</p>

            <p>The Devil puts a Cheat upon us, when he ſhews us the World through his Spectacles, and the Glory of it through his Magnifying-glaſſes, there every Little ſeems Great, and every Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill a Mountain, but when we view it in the clear Cryſtal of God's Word, it appears in its Colours.</p>
            <p>'Tis an eaſie thing to make a man exchange Rags for Robes, and a Cottage for a Caſtle; and is it not as eaſie to perſwade a wiſe man to exchange Pebbles for Pearls, Earth for Heaven, and the Creature for God? When a Man is ſatisfied, that there is enough in Chriſt, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory, to give the Soul Content, yea, to make up all the Loſſes ſuſtained upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, what ſhould make him afraid to venture upon it? But while the World ſeems a Pearl in our Eyes, the Pearl of great price is not heeded. The Splendor of the World ſeems greater than it

            <p>Till we can look upon the World with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, we are neither fit to live, nor fit to dye; not to live, for we ſhall place the love upon her that is only due to God; not to dye, for we ſhall then loſe all our Portion, and what a condition will ſuch a departing Soul then be in? Till we can ſee with <hi>Moſes</hi> the Vanity of Kings Courts, we ſhall never make his choice, as, <hi>the Afflictions of the people of God, rather than theſe Vanities,</hi> Heb. 11.25. Till we can with <hi>Galeacius</hi> ſee more Worth in one days Communion with God, than all the Wealth in the World, we ſhall not leave all as he did, for Chriſt's ſake; till Chriſt be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us than our Company and Relations, as it was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we ſhall never leave all theſe for him; the Martyrs <hi>loved not their Lives to the Death, Rev.</hi> 12.11. and till we can look upon all theſe things with a ſelf-denying Eye, and hang looſe to Creature-comſorts, and can ſay of God as the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee:</hi> Then, and not till then, we are in a fit poſture to live and to dye.</p>

The Example of the penitent Thief I have already
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59683:141"/> ſpoke to; one Swallow proves not a Summer; he that ſails in the Road to Hell, and changes not his Courſe, is never like to land in the Port of Heaven; he that runs down the Hill is not like to come to the top; and he that ſwims down the Stream, will not come to the Fountain Head.</p>
            <p>By Nature we are born with our Backs upon Heaven, and our Face towards Hell, and till we repent we never change our Courſe. A ſinful Life will have a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis our Duty, whatever others do, to be holy, and, like the Moon, hold on our Courſe, though Dogs bark at us, and run our Race like the Sun, though the <hi>Planters</hi> curſe him at his riſing, for ſcorching them with his Beams. Let us not ſwim down the Stream of the Sinner, like dead Fiſh, <hi>nor follow a multitude to do Evil:</hi> The worſe the Places are we live in, the better let us be; the more outragious they are in Wickedneſs, the more couragious in Good let us be. It matters not how ſmall our Company is, if good, nor how great, if bad: 'Tis better be with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, than with the whole World in the Flood. The Way to Heaven, no doubt, will be rough and craggy,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59683:142"/> like that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.4, 13. <hi>Sic petitur coelum,</hi> Pains and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are neceſſary to thoſe that travel this Road; thoſe that will to Heaven, muſt ſail by the Gates of Hell; <hi>Strive</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to enter;</hi> yea, ſtrive to an Agony, as the word imports.

            <p>Now, that the Life be good, 'tis neceſſary that the Heart be good, for from this Fountain good or bad Water flows; but naturally this is corrupt, 'tis not a few good Words or Wiſhes will ſerve the turn, without Heart-reformation, all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begins at the wrong end.

            <p>By Nature <hi>we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and we cannot act from a Principle of Life; if we have it not till the Heart be ſeaſoned with Grace, all we do will ſavour of the Cask, and till it be purged by Faith, no good thing can thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>for without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6.

'Tis fabled of the Fox, that when he firſt ſaw a Lion he trembled; but in proceſs of time he grew bolder: Thus by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Acquaintance we ſhould do with Death, that is moſt amazing, that comes unexpectedly.

               <hi>Leſſon</hi> 7. The Seventh Leſſon we may learn from this ſad and unexpected Providence, is, Seeing all are under a neceſſity of dying, to bring our minds to be willing to dye, how and when God in his Providence ſhall think fit. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all men once to dye, and after death the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Now, 'tis our Duty to ſubſcribe our conſent to this Law. <hi>He that hateth not his father, mother, wife and children, brethren and ſiſters, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14.26. Theſe are Love-Tokens God hath given us, to win our Love, and when he requires them again, 'tis to try whether we love Him, or his Gifts better. 'Tis, as I ſhew'd before, our Duty to ſubmit, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> patiently to the death of our Relations, and ſometimes the Leſſon proves hard enough; but here is a further
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59683:145"/> tryal, we ſhall be put upon to ſubmit to our own Death. When <hi>Job</hi> bore the loſs of his Eſtate and Relations ſo well, the Devil would try him, by afflicting him in his Body and Mind, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> Job 2.4. As if he ſhould ſay, Any thing for his own Life; Cattle, Servants, Children, all ſhall go, ſo he may ſleep in a whole Skin. I know the Leſſon, to be willing to dye, ſeems hard to Fleſh and Blood, but we muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, or we cannot dye well; the ſame Reaſon that makes us ſubmit to another's Death, is good here. I know there are greater Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lying at ſome mens doors than others; 'tis eaſier to part with Poverty than Plenty, Pain than Pleaſure, Sickneſs than Health, and a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than Liberty; but theſe Bleſſings were never given us to croſs our Maker's Will. <hi>Oh Death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that lives at eaſe in his Poſſeſſions, and hath proſpered in all things?</hi> And yet the thoughts of Heaven may ſweeten this alſo. And that I may add ſome Sugar to this bitter Pill, I add theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, our Life is not at our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, neither indeed is it fit it ſhould be; for God is abſolute Lord of all the Works of his Hands; he is the Potter, we are the Clay; if he daſh us with his Foot, who can call him to an Account? For whoſe is the Pot but the Pot-makers? And he made us for his own uſe, and may do with his own as he pleaſeth, and we muſt hold our Tongues and ſay nothing, if he do it. Never had any Man ſuch abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over any thing he called his own, as God
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59683:145"/> hath over us; yet we imagine thoſe Beaſts we call ours, though we have but a ſubordinate Right to them, yet we do them no wrong, if we take away their Life, we neither did, nor can give it to them; and hath not God a greater Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in us? We let him alone with greater matters than our Lives, and contradict him not. He upholds the whole frame of Nature in Being, the whole Fabrick of Heaven and Earth from returning to its Primitive Nothing, and we ſeek not to take the Work out of his hands. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Sun, Moon, and Stars in their inceſſant and unerring Motions, who pour their Influences upon the Earth; he hangs this huge and maſſy Globe upon nothing, and we let him alone with this work; he made thoſe Glorious Lamps of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>for times, and for ſeaſons, and for days, and for years, and the Sun knows his going down.</hi> He it is that ſets Bounds to this great and wide Sea, yea, Bars and Doors, and ſaith, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further, and here ſhall thy proud waves ceaſe,</hi> Job 38.10, 11. He forms the Light, and he creates Darkneſs, and he it is that hath the Keys of Life and Death at his Girdle: <hi>He kills, and he makes alive, and doth whatever pleaſeth him in Heaven, and in the Earth.</hi> Can all the Kings of the Earth, with all their united Force, repel the Univerſal Darkneſs that over-ſpreads the face of the World when the Sun is ſet, or retain the Light while they have it? And ſhould they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, would they not proclaim their Folly? Is it not he that provides Food for every living thing, yea, for thouſand thouſand of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Man takes no care of? And ſhall we leave all theſe things at his diſpoſe? And why? becauſe we cannot take them out of his hand. And are
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59683:146"/> we exempt, and muſt not our Lives be in his Hand, or Power? Shall he that Governs the whole World by his Power and Wiſdom, not be beſt able, and fitteſt to diſpoſe of us, and of our Lives, as well as others? We have not a bit of Bread to eat, but he gives it, nor a Breath to breathe, but he puts it into us; and are we like to maintain our Lives without him, or keep them againſt his will? Is it not he that <hi>pulls down Kings, and ſets up Kings, and diſpoſeth of Kingdoms to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will, even to the worſt of men,</hi> Dan. 4.17. And doth not he beſt know when our Work is done, and when 'tis the fitteſt time to take us hence, without adviſing with us, or asking our Counſel? Or would we only be excluded? Or would we have all others have the like Priviledge? If the firſt, how came we from under the Law? <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to dye, and after death the Judgment.</hi> If all Men muſt have the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of dying when they pleaſe, the World will be too numerous to ſubſiſt, Hell will be empty, and Heaven will have few in it; for moſt Men will live a miſerable Life, before they will dye, though to go to Glory. And is not it beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all this to Divine Wiſdom, that only knows the beſt time? Were our Lives in our Enemies hands, we ſhould dye too ſoon; if in our own, we ſhould live too long; 'tis beſt as it is in God's hand, who beſt knows when our Work is done, and when his Flowers are ripe, and when we are fit for Glory. Let us then with ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe, quiet our ſelves under Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and with <hi>Paul,</hi> ſay, <hi>I am willing, not only to be bound, but to dye at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> And let us breathe out, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Even ſo Amen.</p>

There is in every Man and Woman by Nature a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which cannot be obliterated, to deſire to be Happy, and a ceſſation of Miſery; and though every Man living deſire it, yet few attain it; for the greateſt number, whether through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, miſtake the way to it, or through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Corruption, will not walk in the way that leads to it, but grope after it where it never was, nor can be found, and ſeek it where it never grew, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand have been thus deceived, and undone, in embracing a Cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> and adoring Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures inſtead of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and theſe have run themſelves out of breath, but all in vain, and at Death have found they had miſtaken their way, when it was too late. Some few indeed have ſought after Happineſs in a way of Holineſs, and theſe have it in ſight, and theſe meet with a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſtay their Stomack in the way, but their Feaſt, their Wedding-Supper, is prepared for their Journey's end, even the Marriage of the Lamb. For whatever conceit may poſſeſs the Heart of Man to the contrary, true and compleat Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was never enjoyed by meer Man, on this ſide Death; for here we are Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and this is not our Reſt; we are under Age, and our Inheritance elſewhere: This Life is cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with a thouſand Miſeries, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with compleat Happineſs, which cannot be found on this ſide the Grave, and few find it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59683:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> Now, one part of our Happineſs is to be freed from Miſery, for while we are under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction our Happineſs is not compleat; but till Death we cannot be freed from Suffering; this alone muſt eaſe us of our Burden: the thoughts of this might make us have gentler thoughts of it, and look upon it through other Spectacles: For that Meſſenger be unwelcome to a Priſoner, that comes to knock off his Shackles, and reſtore his Liberty? Death is ſent to tell us our Warfare is accompliſhed, the Field is won, the Enemies are fled, the Victory is ours, and the Crown is ready; it tells us our Work is done in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and we muſt come to receive our Wages. It tells us all our Pains, Aches, Miſeries, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are at an end, and God hath ſent for us in his Triumphant Chariot to the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb,</hi> and to lye for ever in his Boſom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit thoſe Manſions of Glory provided for us; that for a Cottage we ſhall have a Crown, and Robes inſtead of Rags, and that a period is put to all that we call Trouble; and will ſuch a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger diſpleaſe us? This is the time that <hi>all tears ſhall be wip'd away, and ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more,</hi> Rev. 7.17. and 21.4. <hi>God ſhall wipe all their tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain.</hi> See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. Their <hi>Bacha</hi> ſhall be turned into <hi>Barachah,</hi> their Miſery into Melody, the Sighing into Singing, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery into Majeſty, and Mortality ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Life; whatever 'tis that makes our Life uneaſie, ſhall be done away; all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Trouble, ſhall then vaniſh, for <hi>ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more.</hi> Who would not bear one Fit of Sickneſs for Everlaſting Health, a little Pain

In this Life we are always under the Hatches, ſometimes peſter'd with a ſickly, weakly Body, ſubject to a thouſand Infirmities, languiſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pains, and Aches, and Diſtempers, hardly a day free; but Death is the Phyſician that will Cure us of all this.

Holy Men, even <hi>David</hi> himſelf, have ſometimes ſuch deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoughts, upon God's with-drawings; but Death will put all this out of queſtion, they need not then fear their Evidences when they are put into actual Poſſeſſion, nor God's Love when they enjoy the Beatifical Viſion, where they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee one wrinkle more in the Face of God. Here they are peſtered with the Devil's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and 'tis their trouble and grief that he foiſts in ſuch foul Suggeſtions; he lays Snares in their ways to entrap them, Snares in all their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all their Duties, in all their Actions, in all their Relations, in all they ſee or hear, or come to know; but then he ſhall never throw Dart more at us: Here his Inſtruments do moleſt us, ſome by cruel mocks and taunts, ſcoffs and ſcorns; ſome by Wrongs, Perſecutions, and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; there we ſhall be out of their reach. We can hardly open any Senſe, but we let in either ſin or ſorrow. Our own Corruptions bring us no little trouble, this makes us ſuch ſtrangers to God, ſpoils

God hath communicated himſelf more to his People than to others, and done more for them than for others, and ſo laid a greater Obligation upon them than on the reſt of the World, and after all ſhall they prove treacherous? It was a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſin, that it was after God had appeared twice to him, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.9. God may ſay to his revolting People as Chriſt did to the <hi>Jews, Many good works have I done among you, for which of theſe do you ſtone me?</hi> John 10.32. 'Tis not ſo much for others to be afraid of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that are ſtrangers in the Country, but we that have had ſo many to direct us in the way; we that pretend there our Father keeps his Court, that <hi>Jeruſalem that is above is the Mother of us all;</hi> that Chriſt is our Head, our Husband, and our elder Brother, and ſhall be our Judge; that the Saints departed are our Brethren and Siſters in Chriſt; that Heaven is our Inheritance, and thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Glory provided for us; and ſhall we be afraid or unwilling of the Journey?

Yea, ſome of the Heathen, upon the conſideration of the troubles of Man's Life, thought Mortality a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and like <hi>Solomon,</hi> praiſed the day of Death before the Birth-day, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Optimum non naſci proximum mori,</hi> ſaith the Heathen, but little knew what the reſult would be: But a Chriſtian doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs call'd out by God, ſhould not go unwillingly. <hi>Philpot</hi> the Martyr, returns thanks to God he was ſo near the Gate of Eternal Life; and who is it, that being toſſed with the Waves of Trouble, would not land in a Haven of Reſt? 'Tis a ſhame for a Chriſtian, when God gives a clear Call, to linger, with <hi>Lot,</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> much more to look back, with <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, till the Lord pluck them away by force, and deliver them whether they will or no.

We profeſs we believe <hi>there is a reward for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and a God that judgeth the earth;</hi> but do we not in our works deny it? The fear of Death diſcovers our Infidelity, and as our little Faith, ſo our little Love; either we proclaim that we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether there be a Reward, or whether we have any Intereſt in it, or it ſhews we have little love to it. If we believe it, and our Intereſt in it, is it not a wonder we are not impatient of enjoying it, and rather ſeek to ſhorten our Lives than prolong them by unlawful means? Did we love our Husband as we ſhould, we ſhould long for the time when he would fetch us.

Conſider, If we chearfully ſubmit our Wills to the Will of God, and let him diſpoſe of us as he pleaſeth for Life or Death; and make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves to God, and be willing to part with Life it ſelf, if he and his Cauſe require it, whether by a Natural or violent Death, we ſhall then part with it to the moſt Advantage imaginable; nay, 'tis the only way to ſave it, and to deny it unto God, is the way to loſe it, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and the Goſpel, ſhall ſave it: For what is a man profited if he gain
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59683:150"/> the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> We may read of many, that refuſing to lay down their Lives for Chriſt, have had their Lives taken from them, but loſt their Reward.</p>
            <p>We read in the Book of Martyrs, of one <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> a Smith, that had made profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but being call'd to ſuffer, cried, The Fire is hot, I cannot burn; but within a ſhort time he was burnt in his own Houſe, and loſt both his Life and his Reward: And ſo ſhall thoſe that deny their Lives to God when he requires them. We may reſign our Lives into the hands of God, and ſo engage him to look to them, and take care of them, but we cannot reſcue them out of his Hands, or live longer than he determines, for we cannot breathe without him; and then what madneſs is it to ſtand in contention with him? If we loſe our Souls to ſave our Lives, we ſhall make a bad Bargain, for a Life ſaved by unlawful means will do us little good, for a Life in God's diſpleaſure is worſe than Death it ſelf, and a Death in his favor is the beginning of Eternal Life, and uſhers us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternal Happineſs. The Martyrs in the flames were aware of this, they cried out, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt! 'Tis a dear Life that is bought with the loſs of Chriſt; he that exchanges his Soul for the World, will with the Rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. dye a Beggar, but will not be able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one drop of Water; he that loſeth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul purchaſeth an everliving Death; and is it not our Intereſt to look to the main Jewel? Where Self is renounced, the Croſs is eaſily born, for 'tis Self-love that makes it pinch us. When God bids us Yoke, 'tis our beſt way to ſubmit our Necks, for there is no ſtruggling out of his hands.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59683:150"/> God will not require our Lives to our hurt or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, neither will it prove any Advantage to us if we deny them, for if we loſe them for his ſake, we ſhall find them; and if we would hide them from him, we ſhall loſe them, and Heaven to boot. He that lays down his Life when God requires it, will gain by the bargain; when Death ſtrips him of his Rags, 'tis to cloath him with Robes, and pulls down his Cottage to bring him to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>For we know that if this earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> This (ſaith <hi>Latimer</hi>) is the Sweet-meats of the Feaſt of a good Conſcience; there are other dainty Diſhes, but this is the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: The Soul wears the Body as a Garment, which when 'tis worn out, ſhall be clothed with a better Suit. There is no paſſing into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> but under Death's flaming Sword; no coming to the City of God, but through his dark Vault and ſtrait Gate; no wiping all Tears from our Eyes, but with our Winding-ſheet. <hi>Our life is hid,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with Chriſt in God, Col.</hi> 3.3. and therefore not loſt.

A Child that hath a precious Jewel cannot put it ſafer, than in his Father's hands; the like we may ſay of our Lives and Souls, if we'l have the keeping and diſpoſing of them our ſelves, the Devil will rook us out of them; but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to God cannot be loſt; our Lives, though laid down for Chriſt, cannot be loſt in him, 'tis but as the Seed ſown, Life eternal will ſpring up

There is nothing we can expend in God's Service, but he can make ſatisfaction; we may loſe all we have for him, but ſhall loſe nothing by him; if we deny to honour God, in letting God diſpoſe of our Lives, as to the time and manner of our Death, we ſhall loſe them for nothing. <hi>To live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) is Chriſt, and to die is gain;</hi> he was <hi>in a ſtrait, whether to chuſe life or death,</hi> yet he knew to die was beſt for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21, <hi>&amp;c.
